Transpulmonary chemoembolization and microwave ablation for recurrent or advanced non-small cell Lung Cancer,"Thomas J. Vogl, Kuei-An Chen, Hao Li, Mohamed E.M. Fouad, Zahra Afraz, Hamzah Adwan",2024-10-26,"To verify the treatment effect of the combination of transpulmonary chemoembolization (TPCE) and microwave ablation (MWA), targeting the treatment of recurrent or advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 53 patients were studied and grouped according to the diameter of the largest pulmonary nodule, defined as index tumor size (ITS). Patients with an ITS > 3 cm (n = 20) were treated with TPCE and MWA. Patients with an ITS ≤ 3 cm were treated either with a combination therapy (n = 24) or MWA alone (n = 9). The treatment response, including complications and survival outcome, was then analyzed. After TPCE, there was an average ITS reduction of 0.91 cm, and 25% of patients in ITS > 3 cm were downgraded to ITS ≤ 3 cm. After TPCE, there were 12 patients (27%) with PR status and 32 (73%) with SD status. No PD patient in our case series was noted before MWA.The complication rate of MWA was significantly higher in ITS ≤ 3 cm than in ITS > 3 cm (p = 0.013). The median survival time (MST) was 26.7 months, and the time to progression was 13.2 months. The patients in the ITS ≤ 3 cm had longer MST than the others (31.6 vs. 15.8 months, p = 0.003). The significant prognostic factor was ITS > 3 cm (HR: 1.18, p = 0.02). A combination of TPCE and MWA might be feasible to control non-operable, recurrent, or advanced NSCLC.","Transpulmonary chemoembolization, Microwave ablation, Non-small cell lung cancer, Interventional radiology"
Camrelizumab plus apatinib for previously treated advanced adrenocortical carcinoma: a single-arm phase 2 trial,"Yu-Chun Zhu, Zhi-Gong Wei, Jing-Jing Wang, Yi-Yan Pei, Jing Jin, Dong Li, Zhi-Hui Li, Zhe-Ran Liu, Yu Min, Rui-Dan Li, Li Yang, Ji-Yan Liu, Qiang Wei, Xing-Chen Peng",2024-11-29,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Therapeutic options for patients with advanced ACC who have failed standard treatments are limited. Single-agent immunotherapy as a second-line treatment has shown unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. This phase II trial (NCT04318730) evaluated the efficacy and safety of the PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab combined with the VEGFR inhibitor apatinib in previously treated advanced ACC. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 21 patients with advanced ACC received at least one dose of camrelizumab and apatinib. The ORR was 52% (95% CI, 30−74%), meeting the primary endpoint, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 95% (95% CI, 76−100%). The median PFS was 13.3 months (95% CI, 8.4−NE), and the median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI, 11.0−NE). The most common grade 3−4 treatment-related adverse events were alanine aminotransferase elevation, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, and lymphopenia. Predefined exploratory analyses indicated that patients with higher peripheral blood CXCR3 + CD8 + T cell abundance, lower immunosuppressive CD4 + T cell abundance, and higher overlap of clonotypes between tumor-infiltrating T cells and circulating T cells, were more likely to respond favorably to the combined therapy.",
Single-cell sequencing reveals immune features of treatment response to neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Zhenlin Yang, He Tian, Xiaowei Chen, Bozhao Li, Guangyu Bai, Qingyuan Cai, Jiachen Xu, Wei Guo, Shuaibo Wang, Yue Peng, Qing Liang, Liyan Xue, Shugeng Gao",2024-10-22,"Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (nICT) has dramatically changed the treatment landscape of operable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but factors influencing tumor response to nICT are not well understood. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing paired with T cell receptor sequencing, we profile tissues from ESCC patients accepting nICT treatment and characterize the tumor microenvironment context. CXCL13+CD8+ Tex cells, a subset of exhausted CD8+ T cells, are revealed to highly infiltrate in pre-treatment tumors and show prominent progenitor exhaustion phenotype in post-treatment samples from responders. We validate CXCL13+CD8+ Tex cells as a predictor of improved response to nICT and reveal CXCL13 to potentiate anti-PD-1 efficacy in vivo. Post-treatment tumors from non-responders are enriched for CXCL13+CD8+ Tex cells with notably remarkable exhaustion phenotype and TNFRSF4+CD4+ Tregs with activated immunosuppressive function and a significant clone expansion. Several critical markers for therapeutic resistance are also identified, including LRRC15+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages, which may recruit Tregs to form an immunosuppressive landscape. Overall, our findings unravel immune features of distinct therapeutic response to nICT treatment, providing a rationale for optimizing individualized neoadjuvant strategy in ESCC.",
Modified FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab versus bevacizumab in RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase II DEEPER trial,"Manabu Shiozawa, Yu Sunakawa, Takanori Watanabe, Hirofumi Ota, Hisateru Yasui, Taichi Yabuno, Mitsuyoshi Tei, Mitsugu Kochi, Dai Manaka, Hisatsugu Ohori, Tatsuro Yamaguchi, Tamotsu Sagawa, Masahito Kotaka, Yutaro Kubota, Takashi Sekikawa, Masato Nakamura, Masahiro Takeuchi, Wataru Ichikawa, Masashi Fujii, Akihito Tsuji",2024-11-25,"The clinical significance of FOLFOXIRI (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) plus anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody using cetuximab for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains controversial. We report results from a randomized phase 2 DEEPER trial (UMIN000018217, jRCTs061180022) to test the superiority of modified (m)-FOLFOXIRI plus weekly cetuximab over bevacizumab in patients with RAS wild-type (wt) mCRC. Primary endpoint was depth of response (DpR). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), early tumor shrinkage (ETS) at week 8, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to tumor growth (TTG), time to treatment failure (TTF), association between tumor shrinkage and prognosis, association between TTG and prognosis, R0 resection rate, and safety. In 359 enrolled patients with RAS wt mCRC, median DpR was significantly better in cetuximab (57.3% vs 46.0%, p = 0.0029); however, ORR, ETS, R0 resection rate, TTG, TTF, PFS and OS were similar between 2 treatments. There was a weak association between DpR and survival time in both treatments. The correlation between TTG and OS was slightly stronger in cetuximab. The post-hoc exploratory analysis showed that cetuximab produced greater PFS (15.3 vs 11.7 months; HR 0.68) and OS (53.6 vs 40.2 months; HR 0.54) in patients with left-sided and RAS/BRAF wt tumors. m-FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab has clinical benefit for tumor shrinkage in RAS wt mCRC. The survival benefit for RAS/BRAF wt and left-sided mCRC needs further investigation.",
Identification of HER2-positive breast cancer molecular subtypes with potential clinical implications in the ALTTO clinical trial,"Mattia Rediti, David Venet, Andrea Joaquin Garcia, Marion Maetens, Delphine Vincent, Samira Majjaj, Sarra El-Abed, Serena Di Cosimo, Takayuki Ueno, Miguel Izquierdo, Martine Piccart, Lajos Pusztai, Sherene Loi, Roberto Salgado, Giuseppe Viale, Françoise Rothé, Christos Sotiriou",2024-11-29,"In HER2-positive breast cancer, clinical outcome and sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies are influenced by both tumor and microenvironment features. However, we are currently unable to depict the molecular heterogeneity of this disease with sufficient granularity. Here, by performing gene expression profiling in HER2-positive breast cancers from patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab in the ALTTO clinical trial (NCT00490139), we identify and characterize five molecular subtypes associated with the risk of distant recurrence: immune-enriched, proliferative/metabolic-enriched, mesenchymal/stroma-enriched, luminal, and ERBB2-dependent. Additionally, we validate the biological profiles of the subtypes and explore their prognostic/predictive value in external cohorts, namely the NeoALTTO trial (NCT00553358), SCAN-B (NCT02306096), I-SPY2 (NCT01042379), METABRIC and TCGA. Immune-enriched tumors present better survival outcomes, in contrast to mesenchymal/stroma-enriched and proliferative/metabolic-enriched tumors, while luminal and ERBB2-dependent tumors are characterized by low and high rates of pathological complete response, respectively. Of note, these molecular subtypes provide the rationale for treatment approaches leveraging the heterogeneous biology of HER2-positive breast cancer.",
Alternating modified CAPOX/CAPIRI plus bevacizumab in untreated unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 trial,"Sheng Li, Xiaoyou Li, Hanfeng Xu, Jiayuan Huang, Jingni Zhu, Ying Peng, Jun Bao, Liangjun Zhu",2024-12-11,"Previous studies showed encouraging efficacy of alternating FOLFOX/FOLFIRI for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This phase 2 trial (NCT04324476) aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of alternating modified CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin)/modified CAPIRI (capecitabine and irinotecan) plus bevacizumab (anti-VEGF-A antibody) in untreated unresectable mCRC. Induction treatment included capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid D2–8 and D16–22, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 D1, irinotecan 150 mg/m2 D15, and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg D1 and 15 for 28-day cycles (up to six cycles). Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid D2–15 and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg D1 for 21-day cycles were used as maintenance treatment. 52 patients were included. Median follow-up was 25.0 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS; the primary endpoint) was 11.0 months (95% CI 9.0–12.4). Subgroup analyses showed patients with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio<5 or RAS wild-type disease had longer PFS (both P < 0.05). Objective response and disease control were obtained in 38 (73%; 95% CI 59%–84%) and 49 (94%; 95% CI 84%–99%), respectively. Mean depth of response, conversion and no evidence of disease rates were 46.0% ± 26.3%, 23% and 19%, respectively. Median overall survival was 28.1 months (18.4–34.0). Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) occurred in 17 (33%) patients. No treatment-related death was reported. The most common grade 3–4 TRAE were hypertension (13 [25%]), neutrophil count decreased (three [6%]), and hand-foot syndrome (two [4%]). In addition, grade 3–4 TRAE of diarrhea reported in one [2%] patient and no grade 3–4 peripheral neuropathy occurred. Thus, alternating modified CAPOX/CAPIRI plus bevacizumab had promising efficacy and acceptable safety. The regimen may be a novel option for untreated unresectable mCRC.",
Entinostat in combination with nivolumab in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a phase 2 clinical trial,"Marina Baretti, Ludmila Danilova, Jennifer N. Durham, Courtney B. Betts, Leslie Cope, Dimitrios N. Sidiropoulos, Joseph A. Tandurella, Soren Charmsaz, Nicole Gross, Alexei Hernandez, Won Jin Ho, Chris Thoburn, Rosalind Walker, James Leatherman, Sarah Mitchell, Brian Christmas, Ali Saeed, Daria A. Gaykalova, Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian, Elana J. Fertig, Lisa M. Coussens, Mark Yarchoan, Elizabeth Jaffee, Nilofer S. Azad",2024-11-12,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by low cytotoxic lymphocytes, abundant immune-suppressive cells, and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Preclinical PDA models showed the HDAC inhibitor entinostat reduced myeloid cell immunosuppression, sensitizing tumors to ICI therapy. This phase II study combined entinostat with nivolumab (PD1 inhibitor) in patients with advanced PDA (NCT03250273). Patients received entinostat 5 mg orally once weekly for 14-day lead-in, followed by entinostat and nivolumab. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included safety, duration of response, progression free-survival and overall survival. Between November 2017 and November 2020, 27 evaluable patients were enrolled. Three showed partial responses (11% ORR, 95% CI, 2.4%-29.2%) with a median response duration of 10.2 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were, respectively, 1.89 (95% CI, 1.381-2.301) and 2.729 (95% CI, 1.841-5.622) months. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 patients (63%), including decreased lymphocyte count, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia. As exploratory analysis, peripheral and tumor immune profiles changes were assessed using CyTOF, mIHC, and RNA-seq. Entinostat increased dendritic cell activation and maturation. Gene expression analysis revealed an enrichment in inflammatory response pathways with combination treatment. Although the primary endpoint was not met, entinostat and nivolumab showed durable responses in a small subset of PDA patients. Myeloid cell immunomodulation supported the preclinical hypothesis, providing a basis for future combinatorial therapies to enhance clinical benefits in PDA.",
Perioperative Tislelizumab plus intensity modulated radiotherapy in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma with macrovascular invasion: a phase II trial,"Hongyu Pan, Liuyu Zhou, Zhuo Cheng, Jin Zhang, Ningjia Shen, Hongbin Ma, Yao Li, Riming Jin, Weiping Zhou, Dong Wu, Wen Sun, Ruoyu Wang",2024-10-29,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with macrovascular invasion (MVI) have dismal prognosis and there are no standard perioperative therapies. This phase 2 trial (ChiCTR2000036385) aimed to investigate the activity and safety of perioperative tislelizumab plus intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for resectable HCC with MVI. Thirty treatment-naïve patients with MVI received 3 cycles of tislelizumab intravenously (200 mg, every three weeks) and concurrent IMRT (45 Gray in 15 fractions). Primary endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a complete or major pathological response (pCR or MPR), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and safety. Of patients enrolled, 15 (50%) underwent curative surgery followed by adjuvant tislelizumab. The ORR was 30.0% (90% CI 16.6%-46.5%) and the median OS was 18.7 months. Of the 15 patients underwent surgical resection, 10 (66.7%) achieved pCR or MPR and 8 (53.3%) remained recurrence-free. The median RFS were not reached with a median follow-up of 21.77 months (95% CI 12.50-31.03) post-surgery. 4 (13.3%) patients experienced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events. The most common events were thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia. The trial has met the pre-specified endpoints, and these results support further studies of perioperative immunotherapy plus radiotherapy in HCC.",
Cullin-5 deficiency promotes chimeric antigen receptor T cell effector functions potentially via the modulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway,"Yoshitaka Adachi, Seitaro Terakura, Masahide Osaki, Yusuke Okuno, Yoshitaka Sato, Ken Sagou, Yuki Takeuchi, Hirofumi Yokota, Kanae Imai, Peter Steinberger, Judith Leitner, Ryo Hanajiri, Makoto Murata, Hitoshi Kiyoi",2024-12-10,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell is a promising therapy for cancer, but factors that enhance the efficacy of CAR T cell remain elusive. Here we perform a genome-wide CRISPR screening to probe genes that regulate the proliferation and survival of CAR T cells following repetitive antigen stimulations. We find that genetic ablation of CUL5, encoding a core element of the multi-protein E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, cullin-RING ligase 5, enhances human CD19 CAR T cell expansion potential and effector functions, potentially via the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. In this regard, CUL5 knockout CD19 CAR T cells show sustained STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation, as well as delayed phosphorylation and degradation of JAK1 and JAK3. In vivo, shRNA-mediated knockdown of CUL5 enhances CD19 CAR T treatment outcomes in tumor-bearing mice. Our findings thus imply that targeting CUL5 in the ubiquitin system may enhance CAR T cell effector functions to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.",
Acid-exposed and hypoxic cancer cells do not overlap but are interdependent for unsaturated fatty acid resources,"Katarzyna Głowacka, Sébastien Ibanez, Ophélie Renoult, Perrine Vermonden, Maria Virginia Giolito, Kübra Özkan, Charline Degavre, Léo Aubert, Céline Guilbaud, Florine Laloux-Morris, Elena Richiardone, Jérôme Ambroise, Caroline Bouzin, Davide Brusa, Jonas Dehairs, Johan Swinnen, Cyril Corbet, Yvan Larondelle, Olivier Feron",2024-11-21,"Cancer cells in acidic tumor regions are aggressive and a key therapeutic target, but distinguishing between acid-exposed and hypoxic cells is challenging. Here, we use carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) antibodies to mark acidic areas in both hypoxic and respiring tumor areas, along with an HRE-GFP reporter for hypoxia, to isolate distinct cell populations from 3D tumor spheroids. Transcriptomic analysis of CA9-positive, hypoxia-negative cells highlights enriched fatty acid desaturase activity. Inhibiting or silencing stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) induces ferroptosis in CA9-positive acidic cancer cells and delays mouse tumor growth, an effect enhanced by omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Using acid-exposed cancer cells and patient-derived tumor organoids, we show that SCD1 inhibition increases acidic cancer cell reliance on external mono-unsaturated fatty acids, depriving hypoxic cells of essential resources. This bystander effect provides unbiased evidence for a lack of full overlap between hypoxic and acidic tumor compartments, highlighting a rationale for targeting desaturase activity in cancer.",
Mitochondrial heteroplasmy improves risk prediction for myeloid neoplasms,"Yun Soo Hong, Sergiu Pasca, Wen Shi, Daniela Puiu, Nicole J. Lake, Monkol Lek, Meng Ru, Megan L. Grove, Anna Prizment, Corinne E. Joshu, Elizabeth A. Platz, Eliseo Guallar, Dan E. Arking, Lukasz P. Gondek",2024-11-22,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential is the primary pathogenic risk factor for myeloid neoplasms, while heteroplasmy (mutations in a subset of cellular mitochondrial DNA) is another marker of clonal expansion associated with hematological malignancies. We explore how these two markers relate and influence myeloid neoplasms incidence, and their role in risk stratification. We find that heteroplasmy is more common in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, particularly those with higher variant allele fractions, multiple mutations, or spliceosome machinery mutations. Individuals with both markers have a higher risk of myeloid neoplasms than those with either alone. Furthermore, heteroplasmic variants with higher predicted deleteriousness increase the risk of myeloid neoplasms. Incorporating heteroplasmy in an existing risk score model for individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential significantly improves sensitivity and better identifies high-risk groups. This suggests heteroplasmy as a clonal expansion marker and potentially as a biomarker for myeloid neoplasms development.",
The IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab in previously treated lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes: a phase 2 clinical trial,"Juan Jose Rodriguez-Sevilla, Vera Adema, Kelly S. Chien, Sanam Loghavi, Feiyang Ma, Hui Yang, Guillermo Montalban-Bravo, Xuelin Huang, Xavier Calvo, Joby Joseph, Kristy Bodden, Guillermo Garcia-Manero, Simona Colla",2024-11-13,"In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the IL-1β pathway is upregulated, and previous studies using mouse models of founder MDS mutations demonstrated that it enhances hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells’ (HSPCs’) aberrant differentiation towards the myeloid lineage at the expense of erythropoiesis. To evaluate whether targeting the IL-1β signaling pathway can rescue ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with MDS, we designed a phase 2 non-randomized single-arm clinical trial (NCT04239157) to assess the safety profile and efficacy of the IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients. We enrolled 25 patients with a median age of 74 years; 60% were male, 16% had lower-risk MDS, 84% had intermediate-1 risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System score, and 80% failed hypomethylating agent therapy. The study met the primary endpoint of defining the clinical activity of canakinumab, and the secondary objective of determining the safety profile, including the rate of transfusion independence, the duration of response, progression-free survival, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival. The overall response rate was 17.4%, with all responses including hematological improvement. Sequential post-hoc prospective single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of HSPCs and bone marrow mononuclear cells at different time points during therapy showed that canakinumab’s on-target effects in hematopoietic populations expressing the IL-1β receptor decreased the TNF-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway but rescued ineffective erythropoiesis only in the context of lower genetic complexity. This study demonstrates that better stratification strategies could target lower-risk MDS patients more effectively.",
Genomic and transcriptomic landscape of human gastrointestinal stromal tumors,"Feifei Xie, Shuzhen Luo, Dongbing Liu, Xiaojing Lu, Ming Wang, Xiaoxiao Liu, Fujian Jia, Yuzhi Pang, Yanying Shen, Chunling Zeng, Xinli Ma, Daoqiang Tang, Lin Tu, Linxi Yang, Yumei Cheng, Yuxiang Luo, Fanfan Xie, Hao Hou, Tao Huang, Bo Ni, Chun Zhuang, Wenyi Zhao, Ke Li, Xufen Zheng, Wenbo Bi, Xiaona Jia, Yi He, Simin Wang, Hui Cao, Kui Wu, Yuexiang Wang",2024-11-03,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GISTs) are clinically heterogenous exhibiting varying degrees of disease aggressiveness in individual patients. We comprehensively describe the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of a cohort of 117 GISTs including 31 low-risk, 18 intermediate-risk, 29 high-risk, 34 metastatic and 5 neoadjuvant GISTs from 105 patients. GISTs have notably low tumor mutation burden but widespread copy number variations. Aggressive GISTs harbor remarkably more genomic aberrations than low-/intermediate-risk GISTs. Complex genomic alterations, chromothripsis and kataegis, occur selectively in aggressive GISTs. Despite the paucity of mutations, recurrent inactivating YLPM1 mutations are identified (10.3%, 7 of 68 patients), enriched in high-risk/metastatic GIST and functional study further demonstrates YLPM1 inactivation promotes GIST proliferation, growth and oxidative phosphorylation. Spatially and temporally separated GISTs from individual patients demonstrate complex tumor heterogeneity in metastatic GISTs. Finally, four prominent subtypes are proposed with different genomic features, expression profiles, immune characteristics, clinical characteristics and subtype-specific treatment strategies. This large-scale analysis depicts the landscape and provides further insights into GIST pathogenesis and precise treatment.",
CBFA2T3-GLIS2 mediates transcriptional regulation of developmental pathways through a gene regulatory network,"Elizabeth A. R. Garfinkle, Pratima Nallagatla, Binay Sahoo, Jinjun Dang, Mohammad Balood, Anitria Cotton, Camryn Franke, Sharnise Mitchell, Taylor Wilson, Tanja A. Gruber",2024-10-09,"CBFA2T3-GLIS2 is a fusion oncogene found in pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia that is associated with a poor prognosis. We establish a model of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 driven acute megakaryoblastic leukemia that allows the distinction of fusion specific changes from those that reflect the megakaryoblast lineage of this leukemia. Using this model, we map fusion genome wide binding that in turn imparts the characteristic transcriptional signature. A network of transcription factor genes bound and upregulated by the fusion are found to have downstream effects that result in dysregulated signaling of developmental pathways including NOTCH, Hedgehog, TGFβ, and WNT. Transcriptional regulation is mediated by homo-dimerization and binding of the ETO transcription factor through the nervy homology region 2. Loss of nerve homology region 2 abrogated the development of leukemia, leading to downregulation of JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, and NOTCH transcriptional signatures. These data contribute to the understanding of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 mediated leukemogenesis and identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for future studies.",
AR alterations inform circulating tumor DNA detection in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients,"Todd P. Knutson, Bin Luo, Anna Kobilka, Jacqueline Lyman, Siyuan Guo, Sarah A. Munro, Yingming Li, Rakesh Heer, Luke Gaughan, Michael J. Morris, Himisha Beltran, Charles J. Ryan, Emmanuel S. Antonarakis, Andrew J. Armstrong, Susan Halabi, Scott M. Dehm",2024-12-11,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) of cancer patients is associated with poor prognosis, but is challenging to detect from low plasma volumes. In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), ctDNA assays are needed to prognosticate outcomes of patients treated with androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors. We develop a custom targeted cfDNA sequencing assay, named AR-ctDETECT, to detect ctDNA in limiting plasma cfDNA available from mCRPC patients in the Alliance A031201 randomized phase 3 trial of enzalutamide with or without abiraterone. Of 776 patients, 59% are ctDNA-positive, with 26% having high ctDNA aneuploidy and 33% having low ctDNA aneuploidy but displaying AR gain or structural rearrangement, MYC/MYCN gain, or a pathogenic mutation. ctDNA-positive patients have significantly worse median overall survival than ctDNA-negative patients (29.0 months vs. 47.4 months, respectively). Here, we show that mCRPC patients identified as ctDNA-positive using the AR-ctDETECT assay have poor survival despite treatment with potent AR inhibitors in a phase 3 trial.",
Surgery alone versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in patients with stage T2N0M0 esophageal cancer,"Yan Lin, Shou-Feng Wang, Huan-Wei Liang, Yang Liu, Wei Huang, Xin-Bin Pan",2024-11-21,"To compare the survival outcomes of patients with stage T2N0M0 esophageal cancer treated with surgery alone versus those treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Patients with stage T2N0M0 esophageal cancer, who either underwent surgery alone or received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database covering the period from 2000 to 2020. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) between the two treatment groups were compared. A total of 583 patients were included: 267 (45.8%) received surgery alone, while 316 (54.2%) underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Prior to propensity score matching, no significant differences were observed between the surgery alone and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy groups in terms of 5-year CSS (60.86% vs. 59.02%; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–1.29; P = 0.916) and OS (50.64% vs. 49.81%; HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.75–1.12; P = 0.375). After propensity score matching, the 5-year CSS (66.43% vs. 56.67%; HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.89–1.64; P = 0.225) and OS (56.49% vs. 47.37%; HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.85–1.40; P = 0.481) remained statistically similar between the two groups. Subgroup analyses of patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma revealed no significant differences in survival outcomes between the treatment modalities for either histological subtype. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery does not confer a survival advantage over surgery alone in patients with stage T2N0M0 esophageal cancer, irrespective of histological subtype.","Esophageal cancer, Stage T2N0M0, Surgery, Chemoradiotherapy, Survival outcomes"
Cancer-associated fibroblast subtypes modulate the tumor-immune microenvironment and are associated with skin cancer malignancy,"Agnes Forsthuber, Bertram Aschenbrenner, Ana Korosec, Tina Jacob, Karl Annusver, Natalia Krajic, Daria Kholodniuk, Sophie Frech, Shaohua Zhu, Kim Purkhauser, Katharina Lipp, Franziska Werner, Vy Nguyen, Johannes Griss, Wolfgang Bauer, Ana Soler Cardona, Benedikt Weber, Wolfgang Weninger, Bernhard Gesslbauer, Clement Staud, Jakob Nedomansky, Christine Radtke, Stephan N. Wagner, Peter Petzelbauer, Maria Kasper, Beate M. Lichtenberger",2024-11-08,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a key role in cancer progression and treatment outcome. This study dissects the intra-tumoral diversity of CAFs in basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma using molecular and spatial single-cell analysis. We identify three distinct CAF subtypes: myofibroblast-like RGS5+ CAFs, matrix CAFs (mCAFs), and immunomodulatory CAFs (iCAFs). Large-cohort tissue analysis reveals significant shifts in CAF subtype patterns with increasing malignancy. Two CAF subtypes exhibit immunomodulatory properties via different mechanisms. mCAFs sythesize extracellular matrix and may restrict T cell invasion in low-grade tumors via ensheathing tumor nests, while iCAFs are enriched in late-stage tumors, and express high levels of cytokines and chemokines to aid immune cell recruitment and activation. This is supported by the induction of an iCAF-like phenotype with immunomodulatory functions in primary healthy fibroblasts exposed to skin cancer cell secretomes. Thus, targeting CAF variants holds promise to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in skin cancers.",
PU.1 eviction at lymphocyte-specific chromatin domains mediates glucocorticoid response in acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Dominik Beck, Honghui Cao, Feng Tian, Yizhou Huang, Miao Jiang, Han Zhao, Xiaolu Tai, Wenqian Xu, Hansen J.

Bridge, Chao Zhang, Jin Wang, Jian-Qing Mi, Richard B. Lock, Charles E. de Bock, Duohui Jing",2024-11-08,"The epigenetic landscape plays a critical role in cancer progression, yet its therapeutic potential remains underexplored. Glucocorticoids are essential components of treatments for lymphoid cancers, but resistance, driven in part by epigenetic changes at glucocorticoid-response elements, poses a major challenge to effective therapies. Here we show that glucocorticoid treatment induces distinct patterns of chromosomal organization in glucocorticoid-sensitive and resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenograft models. These glucocorticoid-response elements are primed by the pioneer transcription factor PU.1, which interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor. Eviction of PU.1 promotes receptor binding, increasing the expression of genes involved in apoptosis and facilitating a stronger therapeutic response. Treatment with a PU.1 inhibitor enhances glucocorticoid sensitivity, demonstrating the clinical potential of targeting this pathway. This study uncovers a mechanism involving PU.1 and the glucocorticoid receptor, linking transcription factor activity with drug response, and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for overcoming resistance.",
Sentinel lymph node mapping with Indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG) for pediatric and adolescent tumors: a prospective observational study,"Luca Pio, Celine Richard, Tarek Zaghloul, Andrew J. Murphy, Andrew M. Davidoff, Abdelhafeez H. Abdelhafeez",2024-12-03,"Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an important technique in the staging of pediatric melanomas, sarcomas, and potentially useful for other solid tumors. Precise visual localization of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) during the operation is a key challenge of this procedure. Presently, the gold standard method employing Technetium 99 (99mTc) for localization carries a notable false-negative rate. In this context, we propose evaluating the use of Indocyanine Green near-infrared (ICG-NIR) as a supplementary tool to enhance the identification of SLN. A prospective observational study focused on pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing SLNB using ICG-NIR at a single institution from 2019 to 2022. Lymphoscintigraphy with 99mTc was performed before surgery and 99mTc was detected intraoperatively using a handheld gamma probe. ICG was administered intraoperatively and assessed using transcutaneous NIR. The study collected demographic data, intra-operative findings (Technetium 99 m, ICG fluorescence), and histopathological data. Eight patients with a median age of 16 years (range: 8–19 years) underwent fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node harvesting with 100% sensitivity. Sentinel lymph node fluorescence was verified with a positive radiosignal in all patients. No adverse events were recorded. Fluorescence-guided assessment of the lymphatic system is both feasible and effective for sentinel lymph node identification. Nevertheless, larger-scale studies are essential to establish indocyanine green as a viable alternative rather than a complementary technique alongside the gold-standard radioisotope-guided method for sentinel lymph node assessment in children.","Sentinel lymph node, Indocyanine green Technetium‐99, Pediatric tumors"
Nivolumab plus anlotinib hydrochloride in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: the phase II OASIS trial,"Jing Wu, Shilong Zhang, Shan Yu, Guo An, Yi Wang, Yiyi Yu, Li Liang, Yan Wang, Xiaojing Xu, YanShi Xiong, Di Shao, Zhun Shi, Nannan Li, Jingyuan Wang, Dawei Jin, Tianshu Liu, Yuehong Cui",2024-10-15,"Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), possess immunomodulatory properties and have shown promising outcomes when combined with anti-PD-1 antibodies. The OASIS phase II trial (NCT04503967) is designed to determine the clinical activity and safety of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and anlotinib hydrochloride (a multi-targets TKI) as second-line or above therapy in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). From December 2020 to September 2022, 45 patients with GAC and 3 with ESCC were enrolled in this study. The pre-specified endpoints were reached, with the primary endpoint of overall response rate achieving 29.2%. For secondary objectives, disease control rate was 64.6%; median progression-free survival was 4.0 months; and median overall survival was 11.1 months with a manageable toxicity profile. The exploratory analyses unveiled that the balance of gut bacteria and the presence of a pre-existing immune signature characterized by a high percentage of CD68+PD-L1+ PD-1+ macrophages and low pretreatment variant allele frequencies (VAF), as well as low expression of certain cytokines were significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with GAC.",

Mahoney",2024-11-15,"Oncolytic viruses (OV) are designed to selectively infect and kill cancer cells, while simultaneously eliciting antitumour immunity. The mechanism is expected to originate from infected cancer cells. However, recent reports of tumour regression unaccompanied by cancer cell infection suggest a more complex mechanism of action. Here, we engineered vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)ΔM51-sensitive and VSVΔM51-resistant tumour lines to elucidate the role of OV-infected cancer and non-cancer cells. We found that, while cancer cell infections elicit oncolysis and antitumour immunity as expected, infection of non-cancer cells alone can also contribute to tumour regression. This effect is partly attributed to the systemic production of cytokines that promote dendritic cell (DC) activation, migration and antigen cross-presentation, leading to magnified antitumour CD8+ T cell activation and tumour regression. Such OV-induced antitumour immunity is complementary to PD-1 blockade. Overall, our results reveal mechanistic insights into OV-induced antitumour immunity that can be leveraged to improve OV-based therapeutics.",

B-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors emerging from B-cells at different stages of differentiation and exhibiting tumor-specific interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the effect of drug treatments can be influenced by the tumor composition and functional interactions among immune cells. Here, we develop a platform to maintain small fragments of human lymphoma tissue in culture for several days, and use them to test response to small molecules. We collect 27 patient samples representative of different lymphoma subtypes, and establish ex vivo tissue fragments that retain histological, cellular, and molecular characteristics of the original tissue, here referred to as lymphomoids. Using lymphomoids, we test sensitivity to several clinically approved drugs in parallel and examine tissue remodeling upon treatment. Moreover, when this information is available, we show that the effect of the inhibitors observed in lymphomoids is consistent with the patients’ response in the clinic. Thus, lymphomoids represent an innovative ex vivo model to assess the effect of anti-cancer therapies while preserving the tissue structure and its components.",
Concurrent intratumoural Treg cell depletion and CD8+ T cell expansion via a cleavable anti-4-1BB–interleukin-15 fusion protein,"Yueqi Cai, Zilong Han, Jiao Shen, Zhuangzhi Zou, Jingya Guo, Yong Liang, Shijie Li, Huiping Liao, Zhenhua Ren, Hua Peng, Yang-Xin Fu",2024-12-02,"Potent agonists of the inducible co-stimulatory receptor 4-1BB are too toxic for patients with advanced cancer. Here, on the basis of observations of a weak agonist of 4-1BB depleting regulatory T (Treg) cells within the tumour microenvironment without leading to substantial restoration of dysfunctional cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), we show that effective tumour control can be achieved via concurrent Treg cell depletion and CTL expansion through an anti-4-1BB antibody fused to interleukin-15 (IL-15) via a peptide sensitive to tumour proteases. In mouse models of advanced cancers, intraperitoneal injection of the bifunctional protein attenuated the activity of the interleukin mostly in the periphery of the primary tumour while allowing for the expansion of CTLs within the tumour microenvironment, led to more effective tumour inhibition and to lower systemic toxicity than treating the cancers with combinatorial treatment with unlinked anti-4-1BB antibody and IL-15, and reduced the resistance of tumours to checkpoint blockade. Concurrent eradication of Treg cells and activation of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes may represent a general strategy for the effective control of advanced metastatic tumours.",

A total of 532 patients with confirmed PCa diagnosis through biopsy were enrolled from six medical centers in Sudan. The majority of patients, comprising 84.2% (448/532), were diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, with a Grade group above 3. There were no discernible differences in PCa aggressiveness among the ethnolinguistic groups. However, higher levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were observed in the Niger-Congo group, where 55.2% had PSA values exceeding 50 ng/ml. Patients from this group were also diagnosed at a younger age. In contrast, 90.5% of Afro-Asiatic patients are over 60 years old. Further analysis conducted within an age-matched subgroup of patients (n = 273) revealed a higher incidence of perineural invasion in the Afro-Asiatic group. This research represents the first investigation of PCa across different African ethnic groups and associates a higher incidence of perineural invasion with a specific ethnic group. While recent efforts have been made to establish African-relevant risk models to mitigate PCa health disparities, there remains a need for further investigation into genetically distinct populations within the African continent.","Perineural invasion, Prostate cancer, Sudan, Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan, Afro-Asiatic, Incidence"

T cell dynamics with neoadjuvant immunotherapy in head and neck cancer,"Maryann Zhao, Jonathan D. Schoenfeld, Ann Marie Egloff, Glenn J. Hanna, Robert I. Haddad, Douglas R. Adkins, Ravindra Uppaluri",2024-12-10,"Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being tested as neoadjuvant therapies in various solid tumours, including in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with promising results. Key findings thus far include that this approach is well-tolerated with favourable clinical outcomes including promising pathological response rates in initial studies. Pathological responses are likely to be increased by combining other agents with anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies. Comparisons of baseline biopsy samples with post-treatment surgical specimens have enabled correlative studies utilizing multiomic and immunogenomic methods. Data from these studies suggest that pretreatment intratumoural tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells are key drivers of tumour regression and give rise to both local and systemic antitumour immune responses. Analyses of systemic responses have defined a PD-1+KLRG1− circulating CD8+ T cell subpopulation that is highly predictive of response, and revealed the interrelationships between intratumoural clones and circulating CD8+ T cells. Lastly, interrogation of T cell populations within lymph nodes is beginning to delineate the immune crosstalk between the primary tumour and tumour-draining lymph nodes and how this relationship might be disrupted with tumour infiltration of the latter. In this Review, we examine data from trials testing neoadjuvant ICIs in patients with HNSCC, focusing on human papillomavirus-unrelated disease, and highlight correlative immunogenomic findings from these trials.",

The clinical burden of LMD has been increasing secondary to more sensitive diagnostics, aggressive local therapies for discrete brain metastases, and improved management of extracranial disease with targeted and immunotherapeutic agents, resulting in improved survival. However, owing to drug delivery challenges and the unique microenvironment of LMD, novel therapies against systemic disease have not yet translated into improved outcomes for these patients. Underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are common, response assessment remains challenging, and the prognosis associated with this disease of whole neuroaxis remains extremely poor. The dearth of effective therapies is further challenged by the difficulties in studying this dynamic disease state. In this Review, a multidisciplinary group of experts describe the emerging evidence and areas of active investigation in LMD and provide directed recommendations for future research. Drawing upon paradigm-changing advances in mechanistic science, computational approaches, and trial design, the authors discuss domain-specific and cross-disciplinary strategies for optimizing the clinical and translational research landscape for LMD. Advances in diagnostics, multi-agent intrathecal therapies, cell-based therapies, immunotherapies, proton craniospinal irradiation and ongoing clinical trials offer hope for improving outcomes for patients with LMD.",
A bioinspired sulfur–Fe–heme nanozyme with selective peroxidase-like activity for enhanced tumor chemotherapy,"Shuaibing Zhang, Xuejiao J. Gao, Yuanjie Ma, Kexu Song, Mengyue Ge, Saiyu Ma, Lirong Zhang, Ye Yuan, Wei Jiang, Zhenzhen Wu, Lizeng Gao, Xiyun Yan, Bing Jiang",2024-12-05,"Iron-based nanozymes, recognized for their biocompatibility and peroxidase-like activities, hold promise as catalysts in tumor therapy. However, their concurrent catalase-like activity undermines therapeutic efficacy by converting hydrogen peroxide in tumor tissues into oxygen, thus diminishing hydroxyl radical production. Addressing this challenge, this study introduces the hemin–cysteine–Fe (HCFe) nanozyme, which exhibits exclusive peroxidase-like activity. Constructed through a supramolecular assembly approach involving Fmoc-l-cysteine, heme, and Fe²⁺ coordination, HCFe distinctly incorporates heme and [Fe–S] within its active center. Sulfur coordination to the central Fe atom of Hemin is crucial in modulating the catalytic preference of the HCFe nanozyme towards peroxidase-like activity. This unique mechanism distinguishes HCFe from other bifunctional iron-based nanozymes, enhancing its catalytic selectivity even beyond that of natural peroxidases. This selective activity allows HCFe to significantly elevate ROS production and exert cytotoxic effects, especially against cisplatin-resistant esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells and their xenografts in female mice when combined with cisplatin. These findings underscore HCFe’s potential as a crucial component in multimodal cancer therapy, notably in augmenting chemotherapy efficacy.",

Isa 20-mg/kg was administered weekly (QW) in cycle 1, then biweekly (Q2W). Twenty-one extensively pretreated RRMM patients (median 4 prior lines; 95.2% refractory to last regimen), received ≥ 1 dose of Isa. After first IV-infusion, mean maximum observed concentration was 402 μg/mL and mean area-under-the-concentration-versus-time curve (first 1-week dosing interval) 37,000 μg·h/mL. After repeated administration, exposure (Ctrough) increased 3.11-folds (day 1/cycle 2) versus first administration (day 8/cycle 1). Safety findings were consistent with the known Isa safety profile, with no new safety signals. Any-causality, grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 47.6% of patients. Serious, treatment-related AEs occurred in 2 patients. Isa treatment was generally well tolerated; only 1 patient discontinued due to TEAE.

Human single cell RNA-sequencing reveals a targetable CD8+ exhausted T cell population that maintains mouse low-grade glioma growth,"Rasha Barakat, Jit Chatterjee, Rui Mu, Xuanhe Qi, Xingxing Gu, Igor Smirnov, Olivia Cobb, Karen Gao, Angelica Barnes, Jonathan Kipnis, David H. Gutmann",2024-11-28,"In solid cancers, T cells typically function as cytotoxic effectors to limit tumor growth, prompting therapies that capitalize upon this antineoplastic property (immune checkpoint inhibition; ICI). Unfortunately, ICI treatments have been largely ineffective for high-grade brain tumors (gliomas; HGGs). Leveraging several single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we report greater CD8+ exhausted T cells in human pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) relative to adult and pediatric HGGs. Using several preclinical mouse LGG models (Nf1-OPG mice), we show that these PD1+/TIGIT+ CD8+ exhausted T cells are restricted to the tumor tissue, where they express paracrine factors necessary for OPG growth. Importantly, ICI treatments with α-PD1 and α-TIGIT antibodies attenuate Nf1-OPG tumor proliferation through suppression of two cytokine (Ccl4 and TGFβ)-mediated mechanisms, rather than by T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as well as suppress monocyte-controlled T cell chemotaxis. Collectively, these findings establish a previously unrecognized function for CD8+ exhausted T cells as specialized regulators of LGG maintenance.",

Here, we present an in-depth characterization of the bone marrow immune ecosystem of multiple myeloma long-term survivors, from initial diagnosis up to 17 years following a single therapy line and cancer-free survival. Using comparative single-cell analyses combined with molecular, genomic, and functional approaches, we demonstrate that multiple myeloma long-term survivors exhibit pronounced alterations in their bone marrow microenvironment associated with impaired immunity. These immunological alterations were frequently linked to an inflammatory immune circuit fueled by the long-term persistence or resurgence of residual myeloma cells. Notably, even in the complete absence of any detectable residual disease for decades, sustained changes in the immune system were observed, suggesting an irreversible ‘immunological scarring’ caused by the initial exposure to the cancer and therapy.

DUSP6 regulates Notch1 signalling in colorectal cancer,"Chin Wen Png, Madhushanee Weerasooriya, Heng Li, Xiaowen Hou, Fiona Yayuan Teo, Shiying Huang, Zheng Ser, Franklin Yau Kok Weng, Malini Rethnam, Gloryn Chia, Radoslaw M. Sobota, Choon Seng Chong, Ker-Kan Tan, Yongliang Zhang",2024-11-21,"Notch1 plays various roles in cancer development, and Notch1-induced transactivation is controlled by phosphorylation of its cleaved intracellular domain. However, it is unclear whether there are phosphatases capable of dephosphorylating the cleaved Notch1 transmembrane/intracellular region (NTM) to regulate its function. Here, we show that DUSP6 can function as a phosphatase for Notch1, thereby regulating NTM stability and transcriptional activity, thus influencing colorectal cancer (CRC) development. In human CRC cells, elevated DUSP6 expression correlates with increased NTM levels, leading to enhanced CRC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. High tumoral DUSP6 protein expression is associated with poorer overall CRC patient survival. In mice, DUSP6 deficiency results in reduced CRC development. Mechanistically, DUSP6 dephosphorylates phospho-Y2116, which in turn reduces NTM ubiquitination, leading to increased NTM stability and transcriptional activity. As a result, the expression of Notch1-targeted proliferation genes is increased to promote tumour cell growth.",

Dawson, Cosimo Commisso",2024-12-03,"Macropinocytosis has emerged as a scavenging pathway that cancer cells exploit to survive in a nutrient-deprived microenvironment. Tumor cells are especially reliant on glutamine for their survival, and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, glutamine deficiency can enhance the stimulation of macropinocytosis. Here, we identify the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) enzymes, PKCζ and PKCι, as regulators of macropinocytosis. In normal epithelial cells, aPKCs associate with the scaffold proteins Par3 and Par6 to regulate cell polarity, affecting several targets, including the Par1 kinases and we find that each of these proteins is required for macropinocytosis. Mechanistically, aPKCs are regulated by EGFR signaling or by the transcription factor CREM to promote the Par3 relocation to microtubules, facilitating macropinocytosis in a dynein-dependent manner. Importantly, cell fitness impairment caused by aPKC depletion is rescued by the restoration of macropinocytosis and aPKCs support PDAC growth in vivo. Our findings enhance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings that control macropinocytic uptake in the context of metabolic stress.",

We detect neoTCRs with specificity for the previously detected neoantigens and perform fine-characterization of neoTCR-transgenic (tg) T cells in vitro and in vivo. We describe a heterogeneous spectrum of TCR-intrinsic activation patterns in response to a shared neoepitope ranging from previously detected more highly frequent neoTCRs with moderate activation to rare ones with initially stronger activation. Experimental restimulation of adoptively transferred neoTCR-tg T cells in a xenogeneic rechallenge tumor model demonstrates superior anti-tumor responses of moderate neoTCR-tg T cells upon repeated tumor contact.

Here, we find that breast cancer-derived exosomal miR-9-5p induces the expression of HMGCR and CH25H, two enzymes involved in cholesterol synthesis and the conversion of 25-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol by targeting INSIG1, INSIG2 and ATF3 genes in the liver. Notably, in vivo miR-9-5p antagomir treatment and genetic CH25H ablation prevents tumor metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer.

Dual rectification of metabolism abnormality in pancreatic cancer by a programmed nanomedicine,"Bowen Wu, Zhiqin Wang, Jingyuan Liu, Naishi Li, Xudong Wang, HaoChen Bai, Chunling Wang, Jian Shi, Saiyang Zhang, Jian Song, Yiye Li, Guangjun Nie",2024-12-03,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy characterized by dysregulated energy and stromal metabolism. It is strongly supported by activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) which drive excessive desmoplasia and tumor growth via metabolic crosstalk.

The nanosystem is based on a tumor microenvironment-responsive liposome encapsulating an NF-κB inhibitor (TPCA-1) and a CD71 aptamer-linked Glut1 siRNA. TPCA-1 reverses the activated PSC to quiescence, which hampers metabolic support of the PSC to PDAC cells and bolsters the PDAC cell-targeting delivery of the siRNA. Aerobic glycolysis and the following enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation are restrained by the nano-modulation so as to amplify anti-PDAC efficacy in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, which implies more personalized PDAC treatment based on different energy metabolic profiles.",

The patients’ characteristics, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups. No significant differences in the preoperative data were observed between the two groups. The LRAS group had significantly lesser blood loss (P = 0.019), a shorter hospital stay (P = 0.045), and a higher rate of bile leak (P = 0.039) than the ORAS group. There was no significant difference in the operative time (P = 0.156), transfusion rate (P = 0.385), hospital expenses (P = 0.511), rate of other complications, postoperative white blood cell count, and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels between the two groups (P > 0.05).

We identified 215 lesions treated over 48 SRS courses in 34 patients. Median follow up from T-DXd initiation was 13.9 months. The cumulative incidence of symptomatic radiation necrosis at 24 months per lesion was 2.1% and per patient 11%. The 12-month LC was 97%. HER2-low was associated with worse distant intracranial control (DIC) (adjusted HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.6, p = 0.03) and worse systemic progression free survival (PFS) (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6–10.7, p = 0.004). Concurrent SRS and T-DXd has excellent local control, without an increased risk of radiation necrosis. HER2-low disease is associated with worse systemic PFS and DIC with T-DXd compared to HER2+.",
Early evolutionary branching across spatial domains predisposes to clonal replacement under chemotherapy in neuroblastoma,"Jenny Karlsson, Hiroaki Yasui, Adriana Mañas, Natalie Andersson, Karin Hansson, Kristina Aaltonen, Caroline Jansson, Geoffroy Durand, Naveen Ravi, Michele Ferro, Minjun Yang, Subhayan Chattopadhyay, Kajsa Paulsson, Diana Spierings, Floris Foijer, Anders Valind, Daniel Bexell, David Gisselsson",2024-10-18,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most lethal childhood cancers due to its propensity to become treatment resistant. By spatial mapping of subclone geographies before and after chemotherapy across 89 tumor regions from 12 NBs, we find that densely packed territories of closely related subclones present at diagnosis are replaced under effective treatment by islands of distantly related survivor subclones, originating from a different most recent ancestor compared to lineages dominating before treatment. Conversely, in tumors that progressed under treatment, ancestors of subclones dominating later in disease are present already at diagnosis. Chemotherapy treated xenografts and cell culture models replicate these two contrasting scenarios and show branching evolution to be a constant feature of proliferating NB cells. Phylogenies based on whole genome sequencing of 505 individual NB cells indicate that a rich repertoire of parallel subclones emerges already with the first oncogenic mutations and lays the foundation for clonal replacement under treatment.",

However, it is not routinely recorded in structured electronic health records. Here, we present BB-TEN: Big Bird – TNM staging Extracted from Notes, a generalizable method for the automated classification of TNM stage directly from pathology report text. We train a BERT-based model using publicly available pathology reports across approximately 7000 patients and 23 cancer types. We explore the use of different model types, with differing input sizes, parameters, and model architectures. Our final model goes beyond term-extraction, inferring TNM stage from context when it is not included in the report text explicitly. As external validation, we test our model on almost 8000 pathology reports from Columbia University Medical Center, finding that our trained model achieved an AU-ROC of 0.815–0.942. This suggests that our model can be applied broadly to other institutions without additional institution-specific fine-tuning.",

We investigate the detection, timing, and HPV type specificity of somatic mutations in 3929 HPV-positive exfoliated cervical cell samples from individuals undergoing cervical screening in the U.S. using deep targeted sequencing in ICC cases, precancers, and HPV-positive controls. We discover a subset of hotspot mutations rare in controls (2.6%) but significantly more prevalent in precancers, particularly glandular precancer lesions (10.2%), and cancers (25.7%), supporting their involvement in ICC carcinogenesis. Hotspot mutations differ by HPV type, and HPV18/45-positive ICC are more likely to have multiple hotspot mutations compared to HPV16-positive ICC. The proportion of cells containing hotspot mutations is higher (i.e., higher variant allele fraction) in ICC and mutations are detectable up to 6 years prior to cancer diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using exfoliated cervical cells for detection of somatic mutations as potential diagnostic biomarkers.",

Twenty patients with HCC of BCLC stage 0-A received 3\(\times \) Gy SBRT and two cycles of tislelizumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody before the curative HCC resection. Primary endpoints were the surgery delay, radiographic and pathological tumor response after the neoadjuvant therapy, safety and tolerability. During the neoadjuvant therapy, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of grade 1-2 occurred in all 20 patients (100%), eight patients (40%) had grade 3 TRAEs, no grade 4 to 5 TRAE occurred, and all resolved without corticosteroids treatment. Per mRECIST, the objective response rate was 63.2% (12/19), with 3 complete response; the disease control rate was 100%. Two (10.5%) patients achieved complete pathological response. No surgery delay occurred. The neoadjuvant therapy did not increase the surgical difficulty or the incidence of complications. Secondary endpoints of disease-free survival and overall survival were not mature at the time of the analysis. Our pilot trial shows that neoadjuvant therapy with anti-PD-1 + SBRT is safe and promotes tumor responses in early-stage resectable HCC.",
Synthetic lethal strategies for the development of cancer therapeutics,"Natalie Y. L. Ngoi, David Gallo, Carlos Torrado, Mirella Nardo, Daniel Durocher, Timothy A. Yap",2024-12-03,"Synthetic lethality is a genetic phenomenon whereby the simultaneous presence of two different genetic alterations impairs cellular viability. Importantly, targeting synthetic lethal interactions offers potential therapeutic strategies for cancers with alterations in pathways that might otherwise be considered undruggable. High-throughput screening methods based on modern CRISPR–Cas9 technologies have emerged and become crucial for identifying novel synthetic lethal interactions with the potential for translation into biologically rational cancer therapeutic strategies as well as associated predictive biomarkers of response capable of guiding patient selection. Spurred by the clinical success of PARP inhibitors in patients with BRCA-mutant cancers, novel agents targeting multiple synthetic lethal interactions within DNA damage response pathways are in clinical development, and rational strategies targeting synthetic lethal interactions spanning alterations in epigenetic, metabolic and proliferative pathways have also emerged and are in late preclinical and/or early clinical testing.

We show that the DC vaccine not only induces a neoantigen-reactive immune response in lung cancer-bearing mice in vivo, but also facilitate NRT cell preparation in vitro. Adoptive transfer of the NRTs as combinatorial therapy into DC vaccine-immunized, LL/2 tumor-bearing mice allows infiltration of the infused NRTs, as well as the enrichment of neoantigen reactive, non-ACT/NRT T cells into the tumor microenvironment with the function of these neoantigen-reactive T-cell receptors validated in vitro. In summary, we propose a method for preparing NRTs that increases ACT efficacy and paves the way to the design of personalized immunotherapies.",

The primary endpoint, a safety analysis at 4 months, was met. The secondary clinical endpoints of overall survival, distant brain failure, leptomeningeal disease and local recurrence at 12-months were 66%, 37.3%, 6%, and 0% respectively and were not significantly different between arms (p= 0.7739, p= 0.3884, p= 0.3469). Immunological data from two large retrospective BrM datasets and confirmed by correlates from both arms of this pSRS prospective trial revealed that BrM CD8 T cells were composed of predominantly PD1+ TCF1+ stem-like and PD1+ TCF1-TIM3+ effector-like cells. Clustering of TCF1+ CD8 T cells with antigen presenting cells in immune niches was prognostic for local control, even without pSRS. Following pSRS, CD8 T cell and immune niche density were transiently reduced compared to untreated BrM, followed by a rebound 6+ days post pSRS with an increased frequency of TCF1- effector-like cells. In sum, pSRS is safe and therapeutically beneficial, and these data provide a framework for how pSRS may be leveraged to maximize intracranial CD8 T cell responses.",

Combining apatinib with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) likely drives synergistic activity on advanced HCC with extrahepatic metastasis. This phase II trial (ChiCTR2000029082) aimed to assess efficacy and safety of this combination in patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis who have progressed after first-line systemic therapies. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were progress-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), 6- and 12-month survival rates, overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). Thirty-nine patients received oral treatment with apatinib, and hepatic artery infusion oxaliplatinplus raltitrexed. Per RECIST v1.1, the ORR and DCR was 53.8% and 89.7% in the patients population, respectively. The median PFS and OS was 6.2 months and 11.3 months, respectively. The 6- and 12-month survival rates were 81.7% and 44.1%, respectively. All AEs were manageable by medication or dose modifications.

Yet, in-context learning remains underexplored in medical image analysis. Here, we systematically evaluate the model Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 with Vision capabilities (GPT-4V) on cancer image processing with in-context learning on three cancer histopathology tasks of high importance: Classification of tissue subtypes in colorectal cancer, colon polyp subtyping and breast tumor detection in lymph node sections. Our results show that in-context learning is sufficient to match or even outperform specialized neural networks trained for particular tasks, while only requiring a minimal number of samples. In summary, this study demonstrates that large vision language models trained on non-domain specific data can be applied out-of-the box to solve medical image-processing tasks in histopathology. This democratizes access of generalist AI models to medical experts without technical background especially for areas where annotated data is scarce.",
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals over-activated reactive oxygen species pathway in hepatocytes in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Xiaoping Wang, Penghui Li, Huicong Ji, Zhenzhen Xu, Huiwu Xing",2024-11-30,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous tumor and a primary cause of cancer-relevant deaths worldwide. The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HCC development is less studied. Methods: Seurat package and CellMarker database were employed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis based on the GSE189175 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). DAVID and MsigDB database were utilized for pathway analysis. SCENIC analysis was performed to map a transcription factors (TFs) regulatory network. CellChat was used for cellular communication analysis. Results: Six major cell subpopulations were identified, among which hepatocytes accounted for the highest proportion in both cancer and adjacent tissues. The enrichment scores of the 50 hallmark gene sets showed that the ROS pathway was abnormally activated in HCC hepatocytes and positively correlated with energy metabolism-related pathways (glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, etc.). Then, the hepatocytes were divided into four subgroups. Noticeably, GPX4+  hepatocytes with the highest activity of the ROS pathway was related to a worse prognosis of HCC. Mechanism analysis revealed that JUND was involved in the positive regulation of the ROS pathway in GPX4+  hepatocytes. It was found that the interdependent ligand-receptor interaction between GPX4+  liver cells and immune cells facilitated the malignant development of HCC. Conclusion: ROS pathway was over-activated in the hepatocytes of HCC tissues. GPX4+  hepatocytes having the highest activity of the ROS pathway closely interacted with T cells and M2 macrophage cells. Molecular subtypes and risk score signature based on the ROS pathway and its potential target gene JUND are encouraged to be developed for improving the precision treatment of HCC.","Single-cell transcriptomics, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Reactive oxygen species pathway, GPX4+  HCC hepatocytes, CellChat"

Our results identify the spatial organization and immune status of the tumor-stroma boundary as a distinctive feature of dMMR and pMMR CRCs, which associates with ICB response. The physical interactions and abundance of LAMP3+DCs and CXCL13+T cells may shape the ICB-responsive tumor-stroma boundary, whereas CXCL14+cancer-associated fibroblasts tend to remodel extracellular matrix to form a structural barrier in non-responders. Our work therefore points out the importance of the molecular and cellular spatial structures of tumors in ICB response, raising the possibility of reprogramming tumor-stroma boundary for sensitizing immunotherapies in the majority of CRCs.",

Here we show that activation of plasmin, a key fibrinolytic agent, by annexin A2 (ANXA2) distinctly impacts progression of BCR-ABL1+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) via modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the BMM. The dense ECM in a BMM with decreased plasmin activity entraps insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 and reduces mTORC2-dependent signaling and proliferation of B-ALL cells. Conversely, B-ALL conditions the BMM to induce hepatic generation of plasminogen, the plasmin precursor. Treatment with ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA), which inhibits plasmin activation, reduces tumor burden and prolongs survival, including in xenogeneic models via increased fibronectin in the BMM. Human data confirm that IGF1 and fibronectin staining in trephine biopsies are correlated. Our studies suggest that fibrinolysis-mediated ECM remodeling and subsequent growth factor release influence B-ALL progression and inhibition of this process by EACA may be beneficial as adjunct therapy.",

Choueiri, Chelsea Nichols, Deborah Schrag, Nikolaus Schultz",2024-11-12,"Databases that link molecular data to clinical outcomes can inform precision cancer research into novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers. However, outside of clinical trials, cancer outcomes are typically recorded only in text form within electronic health records (EHRs). Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been trained to extract outcomes from individual EHRs. However, patient privacy restrictions have historically precluded dissemination of these models beyond the centers at which they were trained. In this study, the vulnerability of text classification models trained directly on protected health information to membership inference attacks is confirmed. A teacher-student distillation approach is applied to develop shareable models for annotating outcomes from imaging reports and medical oncologist notes. ‘Teacher’ models trained on EHR data from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) are used to label imaging reports and discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. ‘Student’ models are trained to use these MIMIC documents to predict the labels assigned by teacher models and sent to Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) for evaluation. The student models exhibit high discrimination across outcomes in both the DFCI and MSK test sets.

In this investigator-driven, phase I, feasibility study (NCT04262089), 10 women with MMRd EC of any grade, planned for primary surgery, received two cycles of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab (200 mg IV) every three weeks. A pathologic response (primary objective) was observed in 5/10 patients, with 2 patients showing a major pathologic response. No patient achieved a complete pathologic response. A partial radiologic response (secondary objective) was observed in 3/10 patients, 5/10 patients had stable disease and 2/10 patients were non-evaluable on magnetic resonance imaging. All patients completed treatment without severe toxicity (exploratory objective). At median duration of follow-up of 22.5 months, two non-responders experienced disease recurrence. In-depth analysis of the loco-regional and systemic immune response (predefined exploratory objective) showed that monoclonal T cell expansion significantly correlated with treatment response.

In this study, we assessed the prognostic value of ctDNA-based MRD detection in LARC patients using a personalized, tumor-informed ctDNA assay. Plasma samples from LARC patients (N = 30) were analyzed retrospectively using the Signatera™ assay. The neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score was calculated and compared to ctDNA status to predict recurrence risk and survival outcomes. ctDNA-positive patients post-NAT and post-surgery had worse Disease Free Survival (DFS) (HR: 7.82; p = 0.001, HR: 19.65; p = 0.001) when compared to ctDNA-negative patients. In the post-NAT setting, patients who responded to NAT had superior DFS compared to patients who did not clear their ctDNA or showed no radiological response (HR: 24.7, p = 0.001 and HR: 5.1, p = 0.054, respectively). When ctDNA status is used alongside the NAR score in the post-NAT setting, patients who were ctDNA-positive with an intermediate or high NAR score showed significantly worse DFS (HR: 47.5, p < 0.001) compared to ctDNA-negative patients with either a low or intermediate/high NAR score (HR: 9.8, p = 0.0301). Post-NAT ctDNA status, whether used alone or in combination with the NAR score, may predict NAT response, and improve risk stratification.","Circulating tumor DNA, Locally advanced rectal cancer, Biomarker, Neoadjuvant therapy, NAR score"
Whole-exome sequencing reveals genomic landscape of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and identifies SAV1 as a potential driver,"Zheng-Jun Zhou, Yu-Hang Ye, Zhi-Qiang Hu, Yue-Ru Hou, Kai-Xuan Liu, Rong-Qi Sun, Peng-Cheng Wang, Chu-Bin Luo, Jia Li, Ji-Xue Zou, Jian Zhou, Jia Fan, Cheng-Li Song, Shao-Lai Zhou",2024-11-17,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second most common primary hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma, with poor prognosis and limited treatment options. The genomic features of ICC in Chinese patients remain largely unknown. In this study, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing of 204 Chinese primary ICCs and characterize genomic alterations and clonal evolution, and reveal their associations with patient outcomes. We identify six mutational signatures, including Signatures A and F, which are highly similar to previously described signatures linked to aristolochic acid and aflatoxin exposures, respectively. We also identify 13 significantly mutated genes in the ICC samples, including SAV1. We find that SAV1 was mutated in 2.9% (20/672) of 672 ICC samples. SAV1 mutation is associated with lower SAV1 protein levels, higher rates of tumor recurrence, and shorter overall patient survival. Biofunctional investigations reveal a tumor-suppressor role of SAV1: its inactivation suppresses Hippo signaling, leading to YAP activation, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Collectively, our results delineate the genomic landscape of Chinese ICCs and identify SAV1 as a potential driver of ICC.",
Generation of chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting p95HER2 in solid tumors,"Macarena Román Alonso, Ariadna Grinyó-Escuer, Santiago Duro-Sánchez, Irene Rius-Ruiz, Marta Bort-Brusca, Marta Escorihuela, Susana Maqueda-Marcos, Sandra Pérez-Ramos, Judit Gago, Vanesa Nogales, Martín Espinosa-Bravo, Vicente Peg, Santiago Escrivá-de-Romaní, Laia Foradada, Laura Soucek, Irene Braña, Vladimir Galvao, Silvia Martín-Lluesma, Ekkehard Moessner, Christian Klein, Elena Garralda, Cristina Saura, Joaquín Arribas",2024-11-18,"The redirection of T lymphocytes against tumor-associated or tumor-specific antigens, using bispecific antibodies or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), has shown therapeutic success against certain hematological malignancies. However, this strategy has not been effective against solid tumors. Here, we describe the development of CAR T cells targeting p95HER2, a tumor-specific antigen found in HER2-amplified solid tumors. These CAR T cells display robust activity against p95HER2-expressing cell lines but demonstrate limited efficacy against patient-derived xenografts. As p95HER2 is invariably detectable on tumor cells that overexpress HER2, but not those that express HER2 at normal levels, we arm p95HER2-specific CAR T cells with affinity-tuned bispecific antibodies against HER2 and CD3 in order to redirect them only to HER2-amplified cells. The combination of p95HER2.CAR T cells and HER2 x CD3 bispecific antibodies lead to a complete regression in three HER2-positive, patient-derived mouse xenografts tumor models. This combination represents a promising strategy to redirect T cells against a subset of HER2-positive tumors.",

We conducted a retrospective study of 61 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations for suspected gynecological malignancies or metastases between March 2018 and January 2020. Our protocol included four-phase dynamic whole-body scans. High-uptake foci with SUVmax > 2.5 in the abdominopelvic region caudal to the renal portal were picked up and visually evaluated as “changed” (disappeared during any phase or morphological changes in more than half of the foci) or “unchanged” in motion on the serial dynamic images. Focal 18F-FDG uptake was observed in 84 foci. Of the 58 foci determined pathologically or clinically to have pathological uptake, no change was observed on serial dynamic imaging in 54 foci (sensitivity, 93%). Of the 26 foci of physiological uptake, temporal changes in uptake were observed in 20 foci using dynamic imaging (specificity, 77%). The positive and negative predictive values were 90% and 83%, respectively, with an accuracy of 88%. Dynamic whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging allows for differentiation between pathological and physiological uptake in the abdominopelvic region of patients with gynecological cancer.","Whole-body PET/CT, 18F-FDG, Dynamic acquisition, Gynecological cancer, Physiological uptake"
Intrinsic temperature increase drives lipid metabolism towards ferroptosis evasion and chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer,"Vincent de Laat, Halit Topal, Xander Spotbeen, Ali Talebi, Jonas Dehairs, Jakub Idkowiak, Frank Vanderhoydonc, Tessa Ostyn, Peihua Zhao, Maarten Jacquemyn, Michele Wölk, Anna Sablina, Koen Augustyns, Tom Vanden Berghe, Tania Roskams, Dirk Daelemans, Maria Fedorova, Baki Topal, Johannes V. Swinnen",2024-10-02,"A spontaneously occurring temperature increase in solid tumors has been reported sporadically, but is largely overlooked in terms of cancer biology. Here we show that temperature is increased in tumors of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and explore how this could affect therapy response. By mimicking this observation in PDAC cell lines, we demonstrate that through adaptive changes in lipid metabolism, the temperature increase found in human PDAC confers protection to lipid peroxidation and contributes to gemcitabine resistance. Consistent with the recently uncovered role of p38 MAPK in ferroptotic cell death, we find that the reduction in lipid peroxidation potential following adaptation to tumoral temperature allows for p38 MAPK inhibition, conferring chemoresistance. As an increase in tumoral temperature is observed in several other tumor types, our findings warrant taking tumoral temperature into account in subsequent studies related to ferroptosis and therapy resistance. More broadly, our findings indicate that tumoral temperature affects cancer biology.",

ISB 2001 is a CD3+ T cell engager (TCE) co-targeting BCMA and CD38 designed to improve cytotoxicity against multiple myeloma. Targeting of two tumor-associated antigens by a single TCE resulted in superior cytotoxic potency across a variable range of BCMA and CD38 tumor expression profiles mimicking natural tumor heterogeneity, improved resistance to competing soluble factors and exhibited superior cytotoxic potency on patient-derived samples and in mouse models. Despite the broad expression of CD38 across human tissues, ISB 2001 demonstrated a reduced T cell activation profile in the absence of tumor cells when compared to TCEs targeting CD38 only. To determine an optimal first-in-human dose for the ongoing clinical trial (NCT05862012), we developed an innovative quantitative systems pharmacology model leveraging preclinical data, using a minimum pharmacologically active dose approach, therefore reducing patient exposure to subefficacious doses of therapies.",
Sintilimab in combination with stereotactic body radiotherapy and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: The multicenter SWORD phase 2 trial,"Jianjiao Ni, Xiaofei Wang, Lin Wu, Xinghao Ai, Qian Chu, Chengbo Han, Xiaorong Dong, Yue Zhou, Yechun Pang, Zhengfei Zhu",2024-08-22,"This single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 trial (NCT04106180) investigated the triple combination of sintilimab (anti-PD1 antibody), stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). With a median follow-up of 32.1 months, 18 (36.7%, 90% CI 25.3%–49.5%) of the 49 evaluable patients had an objective response, meeting the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included out-of-field (abscopal) response rate (ASR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The ASR was 30.6% (95% CI 18.3%–45.4%). The median PFS and OS were 5.9 (95% CI 2.5–9.3) and 18.4 (95% CI 9.7–27.1) months, respectively. Any grade and grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 44 (86.3%) and 6 (11.8%) patients, without grade 4–5 TRAEs. Moreover, in pre-specified biomarker analyses, SBRT-induced increase of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) in unirradiated tumor lesions and patient’s blood, as well as of circulating IL-21 levels, was found associated with improved prognosis. Taken together, the triple combination therapy was well tolerated with promising efficacy and Tfh may play a critical role in SBRT-triggered anti-tumor immunity in metastatic NSCLC.",

Analysis of 64,097 cells identifies NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs that is confirmed at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induces anti-tumour macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarises Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype. ScRNAseq on 69,781 cells from an HGSOC syngeneic mouse model recapitulates the patients’ data. Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increases survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days + ) are resistant to tumour rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriches the tumours with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increases TBET cell infiltration. Our results suggest that targeting these molecules in immune cells may improve chemotherapy response in patients.",
FBP1 over-expression suppresses HIF-1α in papillary thyroid cancer,"Huashui Li, Wenjun Xie, Xiangqin Huang, Yifan Chen",2024-11-25,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is generally a slow-growing disease with a favorable 10-year survival rate. However, about 10% of PTC cases show significant aggressiveness, with tendencies for local invasion or distant metastasis, the mechanisms of which remain unclear. This study aims to identify predictive indicators and explore new potential targets for clinical treatment, highlighting the need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We analyzed FBP1 expression in PTC tissues. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were evaluated with and without FBP1 overexpression in PTC cells to assess FBP1’s effects. We then investigated whether FBP1 reduces PTC cell tumorigenesis and metastasis by regulating HIF-1α expression. FBP1 expression was reduced in PTC samples and showed a negative correlation with T stage. In vitro experiments indicated that FBP1 acts as a hypoxia response inhibitor, regulating tumor cells. Additionally, FBP1 inhibited the proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells by modulating HIF-1α expression.  Our results provide new insights into the role of FBP1 in PTC progression and indicate that targeting the FBP1-HIF-1α axis could be a promising therapeutic approach for this disease.","Papillary thyroid tumor, FBP1, HIF-1α, Hypoxia"

The algorithm was developed and calibrated in a 2D model and 3D anthropomorphic bladder phantom. The performance was evaluated in vivo in swine and with retrospective clinical cystoscopy video. Results showed that the algorithm was capable of capturing and stitching intravesical images with different sweeping patterns. Between 93% and 99% of frames had sufficient features for bladder map generation. Upon reevaluation, the cystoscope accurately localized a frame within 4.5 s. In swine, a virtual mucosal surface map was generated that matched the explant anatomy. A surface map could be generated based on archived patient cystoscopy images. This tool could aid recording and referencing pathologic findings and biopsy or treatment locations for subsequent procedures and may have utility in patients with metachronous bladder cancer and in low-resource settings.","Bladder map, Image stitching, Cystoscope, Cystoscopy"

A total of 471 women representing the Korean population were recruited. The lifetime risk of breast/ovarian cancer were given numerically followed by graphically in hypothetical BRCA1/2 PV-positive cases. Subsequently, the study participants were asked for their willingness to undergo RRSO/RRM. When the ovarian cancer risk was shown as 44.0%, the percentage of study participants who chose RRSO was 41.0% after numerical presentation versus 39.9% after graphical display, of which the difference was not significant. When the breast cancer risk was presented as 72.0%, 30.4% of the participants opted for RRM under numerical presentation, whereas this increased to 38.6% under graphical display, of which the difference was significant (p < 0.0075). The average levels of the cancer risk which study participants consider RR surgery were 57.1% for ovarian cancer and 60.6% for breast cancer. This suggests that the impacts of different formats of risk communication on decision about RRSO or RRM may be different by the absolute levels of ovarian or breast cancer.","Genetic testing, BRCA, Graphical presentation, Breast cancer, Ovarian cancer"

Single center evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of CellDetect assay in early bladder cancer patients,"Wenbo Gao, Zhiling Lou",2024-11-24,"Until recently, the main diagnostic methods for bladder cancer (BC) are still voided urine cytology and cystoscopy, and many drawbacks persist. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the CellDetect assay in the detection of BC with comparison to standard diagnostic methods. Between August 2020 and July 2022, B-ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) scan was performed for patients with hematuria or irritative voiding symptoms. If no bladder mass was detected, the patient was excluded. A total of 148 patients with bladder mass formed the final study cohort. The patients’ urine samples were measured with CellDetect assay, followed by cystoscopy or diagnostic transurethral resection of bladder tumor. The patients were divided into two groups based on previous history of BC: group P and group R. The analysis included descriptive statistics and percentages. Finally, 115 cases had a positive CellDetect result, with 68 cases in group P and 47 in group R, respectively. And 134 cases revealed malignant tumor pathologically. The overall sensitivity and specificity for all patients were 82.1% and 64.2%, respectively. Concerning the subgroups, the respective sensitivity and specificity were: in group P- 81.0% and 50.0%; and in group R- 85.2% and 83.3%, respectively. In conclusion, CellDetect assay demonstrated significant performance for diagnosis of BC: it can identify BC patients at early stage with significant diagnostic performance and good reliability.

The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 1st quarter of 2019 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 was retrospectively queried to extract reports of cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) associated with amivantamab. To perform disproportionality analysis, the reporting odds ratios (RORs) and information components (ICs) were calculated with statistical shrinkage trans-formation formulas and a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for ROR (ROR025) > 1 or IC (IC025) > 0 with at least 3 reports was considered statistically significant. A total of 20,270,918 eligible records were identified, among which 98 records were related to cardiovascular events associated with amivantamab. 4 categories of cardiovascular events exhibited positive signals: venous thrombotic diseases, abnormal blood pressure, arrhythmia, and pericardial effusion. Venous thrombotic diseases and abnormal blood pressure were the two most common signals. The median time to onset (TTO) for cardiovascular AEs was 33 days. The cumulative incidence within 90 days was 100% for cardiac failure, 75% for stroke, 63.16% for arrhythmia, 50% for sudden death, and 44.18% for venous thrombotic diseases. Death accounted for 16.3% of all cardiovascular AEs associated with amivantamab. The mortality rates for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) were up to 60%.

Upon binding with PD-L1, TPM1 transforms into fibrillar networks in situ to facilitate the aggregation of both bound and unbound PD-L1, thereby resulting in the blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Characterizations of TPM1 manifest a prolonged retention in tumour ( > 7 days) and anti-cancer effects associated with reinvigorating CD8+ T cells in multiple mice tumour models.

Here, we describe a strategy that overcomes CAR-NK cell inhibition mediated by the HLA-E-NKG2A immune checkpoint. We generate CD33-specific, AML-targeted CAR-NK cells (CAR33) combined with CRISPR/Cas9-based gene disruption of the NKG2A-encoding KLRC1 gene. Using single-cell multi-omics analyses, we identified transcriptional features of activation and maturation in CAR33-KLRC1ko-NK cells, which are preserved following exposure to AML cells. Moreover, CAR33-KLRC1ko-NK cells demonstrate potent antileukemic killing activity against AML cell lines and primary blasts in vitro and in vivo. We thus conclude that NKG2A-deficient CAR-NK cells have the potential to bypass immune suppression in AML.",
Nomogram for predicting all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality after TURBT for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer,"Yao Luo, Sujing Wei, Jing Yang, Zaixiang Tan",2024-11-20,"The main purpose of this study was to construct two nomograms to predict all-cause mortality (ACM) and cause-specific mortality (CSM) in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients after transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBTs). We selected NMIBC patients who underwent TURBT between 2004 and 2017 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The patients were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3. The independent influencing factors of ACM and CSM in the training set were determined by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. We then integrated those independent influencing factors to construct nomograms. These prediction nomograms were further verified in the validation set. The C-index, calibration curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve were used to evaluate the identification, calibration, predictive ability and clinical effectiveness of the nomograms. A total of 28,086 cases were ultimately included in this study, which were divided into a training set (19,661 individuals) and a validation set (8425 individuals). Nine variables, including age at diagnosis, race, marital status, tumor grade, T stage, tumor size, number of tumors, and primary site, were obtained via multivariate Cox regression of the training set and used to construct two nomograms prediction model. The C-index values for the ACM nomogram were 0.743 and 0.741 for the training and validation sets, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding values of the C-index for the CSM nomogram were 0.785 and 0.786, respectively. The ROC curves, calibration curves, and DCA curves showed good predictive performance. The nomograms can assist clinicians in identifying high-risk populations and devising more individualized treatment strategies for NMIBC patients.","Nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, All-cause mortality, Cause-specific mortality, Nomogram, TURBT, SEER"

The primary endpoints were overall response rates and minimal residual disease negative rates. Results: The median age of the 10 patients was 62 (range 55–81) years. R-ISS stage 3 was present in 2 (20%) patients. 3 patients had high risk cytogenetic and 1 patient with plasma cell leukocyte. According to IMWG criteria, the ORR of 10 patients with NDMM was 100%, including 2 stringent complete response (sCR), 2 complete remission (CR), 4 very good partial response (VGPR) and 2 partial response (PR). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were not achieved. The most common grade 3–4 treatment-emergent adverse events (occurring in 10% of patients) were thrombocytopenia. The most common non-hematological adverse events were grade 1 or 2, including nausea (30%), fatigue (40%), and anorexia (20%). Overall, the severe toxicities were manageable. Conclusion: The XVRd regimen had good efficacy and safety in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease.","Multiple myeloma, Selinexor, Extramedullary disease"
IL36G-producing neutrophil-like monocytes promote cachexia in cancer,"Yoshihiro Hayashi, Yasushige Kamimura-Aoyagi, Sayuri Nishikawa, Rena Noka, Rika Iwata, Asami Iwabuchi, Yushin Watanabe, Natsumi Matsunuma, Kanako Yuki, Hiroki Kobayashi, Yuka Harada, Hironori Harada",2024-09-12,"Most patients with advanced cancer develop cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive skeletal muscle wasting. Despite its catastrophic impact on survival, the critical mediators responsible for cancer cachexia development remain poorly defined. Here, we show that a distinct subset of neutrophil-like monocytes, which we term cachexia-inducible monocytes (CiMs), emerges in the advanced cancer milieu and promotes skeletal muscle loss. Unbiased transcriptome analysis reveals that interleukin 36 gamma (IL36G)-producing CD38+ CiMs are induced in chronic monocytic blood cancer characterized by prominent cachexia. Notably, the emergence of CiMs and the activation of CiM-related gene signatures in monocytes are confirmed in various advanced solid cancers. Stimuli of toll-like receptor 4 signaling are responsible for the induction of CiMs. Genetic inhibition of IL36G-mediated signaling attenuates skeletal muscle loss and rescues cachexia phenotypes in advanced cancer models. These findings indicate that the IL36G-producing subset of neutrophil-like monocytes could be a potential therapeutic target in cancer cachexia.",
"Benefit of systemic therapy in MINDACT patients with small, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers","Florentine S. Hilbers, Coralie Poncet, Konstantinos Tryfonidis, Giuseppe Viale, Suzette Delaloge, Jean-Yves Pierga, Etienne G. C. Brain, Isabel T. Rubio, Alastair M. Thompson, Emiel J. T. Rutgers, Martine J. Piccart, Laura J. van ’t Veer, Fatima Cardoso",2024-11-02,"Small, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-), lymph node-negative breast cancers are associated with relatively low rates of disease recurrence and have therefore been underrepresented in clinical trials assessing the effects of systemic therapy. Consequently, it remains uncertain if this patient population derives benefit from these treatments. For this exploratory analysis, we selected MINDACT (NCT00433589) patients with a HR+, HER2-, T1ab (≤1 cm) tumor and negative lymph nodes. Patients with discordant clinical risk and MammaPrint genomic risk classification were randmomized to receive chemotherapy based on either the clinical or the genomic risk assessment. Endocrine therapy treatment was based on local guidelines. 715/6693 (10.7%) MINDACT patients had HR+, HER2-, T1abN0 breast cancer and were included in this analysis. All were clinically low-risk, 124/715 (17.3%) were genomic high-risk. For genomic high-risk tumors, 8-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was 92.9% (95% CI 86.2–96.4%) compared to 95.0% (95% CI 92.8–96.6%) for genomic low-risk tumors. For genomic high-risk tumors treated with or without chemotherapy, 8-year DMFS was 89.2% (95% CI 73.6–95.8%) and 94.1% (95% CI 82.9–98.1%), respectively. For genomic low-risk tumors, the 8-year DMFS and disease-free survival (DFS) were 96.1% (95% CI 93.4–97.6%) and 89.3% (95% CI 85.5–92.2%) when treated with endocrine therapy and 92.9% (95% CI 87.9–95.9%) and 79.4% (95% CI 72.5–84.8%) without. In conclusion, although the number of randomized patients is small, patients with small, genomic high-risk breast cancer did not seem to derive benefit from chemotherapy. Endocrine therapy was associated with improved outcomes even in genomic low-risk breast cancers.",
Timing of whole genome duplication is associated with tumor-specific MHC-II depletion in serous ovarian cancer,"Nikki L. Burdett, Madelynne O. Willis, Ahwan Pandey, Laura Twomey, Sara Alaei, Australian Ovarian Cancer Study Group, David D. L. Bowtell, Elizabeth L. Christie",2024-07-18,"Whole genome duplication is frequently observed in cancer, and its prevalence in our prior analysis of end-stage, homologous recombination deficient high grade serous ovarian cancer (almost 80% of samples) supports the notion that whole genome duplication provides a fitness advantage under the selection pressure of therapy. Here, we therefore aim to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in primary high grade serous ovarian cancer with whole genome duplication by assessing differentially expressed genes and pathways in 79 samples. We observe that MHC-II expression is lowest in tumors which have acquired whole genome duplication early in tumor evolution, and further demonstrate that reduced MHC-II expression occurs in subsets of tumor cells rather than in canonical antigen-presenting cells. Early whole genome duplication is also associated with worse patient survival outcomes. Our results suggest an association between the timing of whole genome duplication, MHC-II expression and clinical outcome in high grade serous ovarian cancer that warrants further investigation for therapeutic targeting.",

Postoperatively patients continued assigned treatment for a maximum of 2 years. Postoperative bevacizumab was optional. The primary endpoint was independently assessed CRR at interval debulking surgery. Secondary endpoints were Completeness of Cytoreduction Index (CCI) and peritoneal cancer index (PCI) scores, objective and best response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, postoperative morbidity, and pathological complete response. The CRR in 61 pembrolizumab-treated patients was 74% (one-sided 95% CI = 63%), exceeding the prespecified ≥50% threshold and meeting the primary objective. The CRR without pembrolizumab was 70% (one-sided 95% CI = 54%). In the remaining patients CCI scores were ≥3 in 27% of the standard-of-care group and 18% of the investigational group and CC1 in 3% of the investigational group. PCI score decreased by a mean of 9.6 in the standard-of-care group and 10.2 in the investigational group. Objective response rates were 60% and 72%, respectively, and best overall response rates were 83% and 90%, respectively. Progression-free survival was similar with the two regimens (median 20.8 versus 19.4 months in the standard-of-care versus investigational arms, respectively) but overall survival favored pembrolizumab-containing therapy (median 35.3 versus 49.8 months, respectively). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events with pembrolizumab-containing therapy were anemia during neoadjuvant therapy and infection/fever postoperatively. Pembrolizumab was discontinued prematurely because of adverse events in 23% of pembrolizumab-treated patients. Combining pembrolizumab with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is feasible for HGSC considered not completely resectable; observed activity in some subgroups justifies further evaluation to improve understanding of the role of immunotherapy in HGSC.",
Increased cell killing effect in neutron capture enhanced proton beam therapy,"Shintaro Shiba, Takahiro Shimo, Masashi Yamanaka, Takayuki Yagihashi, Makoto Sakai, Tatsuya Ohno, Koichi Tokuuye, Motoko Omura",2024-11-18,"Thermal neutrons generated in the body during proton beam therapy (PBT) can be used to cause boron neutron capture reactions and have recently been proposed as neutron capture enhanced PBT (NCEPBT). However, the cell killing effect of NCEPBT remains underexplored. Here, we show an increase in the cell killing effect of NCEPBT. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we showed that neutrons generated by proton beam irradiation are uniformly spread on tissue culture plates. Human salivary gland tumor cell line (HSG), human osteosarcoma cell line (MG63), human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SAS), and human malignant melanoma cell line (G-361) were irradiated with X-rays, proton beams, and proton beams with 10B-enriched  boronophenylalanine (boron concentration of 20 and 80 ppm). The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values of proton beams alone, proton beams with 20 ppm boron, and proton beams with 80 ppm boron for HSG, MG63, SAS, and G-361 were 1.02, 1.07, and 1.23; 1.01, 1.08, and 1.44; 1.05, 1.09, and 1.46; and 1.04, 1.13, and 1.63, respectively. NCEPBT with high boron concentration showed high RBE and a high sensitizing effect. Our results confirm an increase in the cell killing effect of NCEPBT, should aid in its clinical use, and warrant its further investigation.","Proton beam therapy, Neutron capture enhanced proton beam therapy, Radiotherapy, Boron neutron capture reaction, Boron neutron capture therapy, Boronophenylalanine"
Multi-omics with dynamic network biomarker algorithm prefigures organ-specific metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma,"Xiaoshen Zhang, Kai Xiao, Yaokai Wen, Fengying Wu, Guanghui Gao, Luonan Chen, Caicun Zhou",2024-11-14,"Efficacious strategies for early detection of lung cancer metastasis are of significance for improving the survival of lung cancer patients. Here we show the marker genes and serum secretome foreshadowing the lung cancer site-specific metastasis through dynamic network biomarker (DNB) algorithm, utilizing two clinical cohorts of four major types of lung cancer distant metastases, with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary lesions and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data of sera. Also, we locate the intermediate status of cancer cells, along with its gene signatures, in each metastatic state trajectory that cancer cells at this stage still have no specific organotropism. Furthermore, an integrated neural network model based on the filtered scRNA-seq data is successfully constructed and validated to predict the metastatic state trajectory of cancer cells. Overall, our study provides an insight to locate the pre-metastasis status of lung cancer and primarily examines its clinical application value, contributing to the early detection of lung cancer metastasis in a more feasible and efficacious way.",
Genomic and immune heterogeneity of multiple synchronous lung adenocarcinoma at different developmental stages,"Yue Zhao, Jian Gao, Jun Wang, Fanfan Fan, Chao Cheng, Danwen Qian, Ran Guo, Yang Zhang, Ting Ye, Marcellus Augustine, Yicong Lin, Jun Shang, Hang Li, Yunjian Pan, Qingyuan Huang, Haiqing Chen, Han Han, Zhendong Gao, Qiming Wang, Shiyue Zhang, Mou Zhang, Fangqiu Fu, Yueren Yan, Shanila Fernandez Patel, Roberto Vendramin, Hui Yuan, Yawei Zhang, Jiaqing Xiang, Hong Hu, Yihua Sun, Yuan Li, Kevin Litchfield, Zhiwei Cao, Haiquan Chen",2024-09-10,"Multiple synchronous lung cancers (MSLCs) constitute a unique subtype of lung cancer. To explore the genomic and immune heterogeneity across different pathological stages of MSLCs, we analyse 16 MSLCs from 8 patients using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell TCR sequencing, and bulk whole-exome sequencing. Our investigation indicates clonally independent tumours with convergent evolution driven by shared driver mutations. However, tumours from the same individual exhibit few shared mutations, indicating independent origins. During the transition from pre-invasive to invasive adenocarcinoma, we observe a shift in T cell phenotypes characterized by increased Treg cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells, accompanied by diminished cytotoxicity. Additionally, invasive adenocarcinomas exhibit greater neoantigen abundance and a more diverse TCR repertoire, indicating heightened heterogeneity. In summary, despite having a common genetic background and environmental exposure, our study emphasizes the individuality of MSLCs at different stages, highlighting their unique genomic and immune characteristics.",
Phase II study of uPAR-PET/CT for staging of primary breast cancer in comparison with ultrasound and fine needle biopsies,"Marie Øbro Fosbøl, Esben Andreas Carlsen, Malene Brandt-Larsen, Camilla Christensen, Jacob Madsen, Annika Loft, Anne Kiil Berthelsen, Tove Filtenborg Tvedskov, Niels Kroman, Kim Francis Andersen, Eric von Benzon, Andreas Kjaer",2024-10-30,"Accurate initial staging of patients with breast cancer is essential for planning optimal treatment strategies. However, currently, no imaging modality is able to detect lymph node metastases preoperatively with sufficient reliability; therefore, the N status depends on the sentinel node procedure for ~ 70% of patients. In a prospective clinical trial of breast cancer patients, we compared head-to-head uPAR-PET/CT with current standard-of-care, ultrasound (US) and fine needle biopsy (FNB) as staging methods. Forty-nine patients (48 women and 1 man) with biopsy-proven early breast cancer underwent uPAR-PET/CT prior to surgery. All image data were analyzed by two separate teams, each consisting of a highly experienced certified specialist in nuclear medicine and a highly experienced certified specialist in radiology for visualization of primary tumor lesions and detection of lymph node and distant metastases. Histopathological assessment and verification of malignancy in the excised tissues (primary tumors and lymph nodes) were considered standard-of-truth. On a per patient basis, uPAR PET/CT demonstrated a sensitivity of 94% [CI: 83–99%] for detecting the primary tumor (both teams). For the detection of axillary lymph nodes the pooled sensitivity of uPAR PET/CT was 33.3% [CI: 16.5–54.0%], specificity 87.0% [CI: 66.4–97.2%] and accuracy 58.0% [CI: 43.2–71.8%]. In comparison, the standard-of-care preoperative clinical staging algorithm with US and FNB had a sensitivity of 41% [CI: 22–61%] and specificity of 100% [CI: 85–100%] for axillary lymph node metastases. We conclude that the results do not support the use of uPAR PET/CT for staging in breast cancer patients. However, the finding that 94% of primary tumors were uPAR-PET positive may be encouraging for pursuing uPAR theranostics in localized disease. Additionally, other potential applications, such as using uPAR-PET as a prognostic imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness, remain to be investigated.",

Patients with stage II/III early breast cancer planning to undergo adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive PG2 500 mg or placebo on days 1, 3, and 8 every 21 days. The fatigue global score (FGS) was assessed using the brief fatigue inventory (BFI)-Taiwan. The Breast Cancer-Specific Module of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires-Core30 evaluated the health-related quality of life during the first four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall, 66 eligible patients were equally randomized into the PG2 and placebo groups between March 01, 2018, and March 09, 2021. The mean change in the FGS and fatigue intensity did not significantly differ between both groups. However, the FGS and fatigue intensity were less aggravated in the first four cycles in the premenopausal-PG2 group than in the placebo group. Our study concluded PG2 combined with adjuvant chemotherapy can reduce CIF, insomnia, the negative effect on future perspectives, and improve global health status, especially for premenopausal patients with breast cancer. Trial registration number: NCT03314805 registered on 19/10/2017.","Astragalus polysaccharides, Cancer-related fatigue, Chemotherapy-related fatigue, Breast cancer, Adjuvant chemotherapy"

We analyzed IDFS and brain metastasis (BM) rates in patients with HER2(+) EBC treated with NAST and report the outcomes of patients with HER2(−) RD. Patients with HER2(+) EBC who received NAST between 1 Jan 2019 and 31 Jan 2022 were reviewed. IDFS was defined as the time from surgery until first occurrence of invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, or death from any cause. The total cohort was 594 patients. pCR (ypT0/isN0) was achieved in 325(55%) and RD was seen in 269(45%) patients. In 269 patients with RD, 45(17%) did not have HER2 retesting and were excluded. In the remaining 224 patients, 143(64%) were HER2(+) and 81(36%) were HER2(−). With a median follow up of 24 months, 8 patients developed BM at initial recurrence, 4/325(1.2%) with pCR and 4/143(2.8%) with HER2(+) RD. IDFS events occurred in 22/594(3%) patients; 14/269(5%) in RD and 8/325(2%) in pCR (p = 0.04). There was no difference in IDFS between 9/143(6%) patients with HER2(+) RD or 5/81(6%) with HER2(−) RD (p = 0.10). Patients with RD had higher IDFS events than those with pCR. In those with RD, 36% lost HER2(+) status; IDFS events appeared similar in those with HER2(+) RD versus those with HER2(−) RD. The BM events seen in those with RD and pCR highlights the need for more effective therapy in NAST and adjuvant setting to minimize BM risk.",

Eligible patients with colorectal cancer (Cohort A) or noncolorectal and nonesophageal GI cancer (Cohort C) received six cycles of anlotinib plus standard chemotherapeutic regimens followed by anlotinib plus metronomic capecitabine as a maintenance therapy. Liver metastasectomy can be performed when liver metastases are converted to resectable lesions. The primary outcome was the investigator-confirmed objective response rate (ORR) in the intention-to-treat population. Among the 47 patients in Cohort A, the ORR was 40.4% (95% CI 26.4–55.7), including 1 with a complete response (CR) and 18 who achieved a partial response (PR). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.7 months (95% CI 7.3-NE), and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached. In Cohort C, 14 of 44 patients achieved a PR, with an ORR of 31.8% (95% CI 18.6–47.6). The PFS and OS were 5.8 months (95% CI 4.8–6.5) and 11.4 months (95% CI 5.8–19.3), respectively. The liver metastasectomy rate in patients with liver-limited disease was 22.7% (5/22) in Cohort A and 6.7% (2/30) in Cohort C. For pancreatic cancer patients, the ORR of the efficacy-evaluable population was 36.0% (9/25), and those with liver-limited metastasis had better survival. Moreover, no new safety concerns emerged. In conclusion, an anlotinib-based first-line regimen demonstrated promising antitumor activity among GI cancer patients with unresectable liver metastases and led to liver metastasectomy in selected patients.",
Single-cell and spatial transcriptome analyses reveal tertiary lymphoid structures linked to tumour progression and immunotherapy response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Yang Liu, Shuang-Yan Ye, Shuai He, Dong-Mei Chi, Xiu-Zhi Wang, Yue-Feng Wen, Dong Ma, Run-Cong Nie, Pu Xiang, You Zhou, Zhao-Hui Ruan, Rou-Jun Peng, Chun-Ling Luo, Pan-Pan Wei, Guo-Wang Lin, Jian Zheng, Qian Cui, Mu-Yan Cai, Jing-Ping Yun, Junchao Dong, Hai-Qiang Mai, Xiaojun Xia, Jin-Xin Bei",2024-09-04,"Tertiary lymphoid structures are immune cell aggregates linked with cancer outcomes, but their interactions with tumour cell aggregates are unclear.

We identify essential cell populations in tertiary lymphoid structure, including CXCL13+ cancer-associated fibroblasts, stem-like CXCL13+CD8+ T cells, and B and T follicular helper cells. Our study shows that germinal centre reaction matures plasma cells. These plasma cells intersperse with tumour cell aggregates, promoting apoptosis of EBV-related malignant cells and enhancing immunotherapy response. CXCL13+ cancer-associated fibroblasts promote B cell adhesion and antibody production, activating CXCL13+CD8+ T cells that become exhausted in tumour cell aggregates. Tertiary lymphoid structure-related cell signatures correlate with prognosis and PD-1 blockade response, offering insights for therapeutic strategies in cancers.",

Using this difference as an example, we queried the mechanism(s) behind the proclivity for organ-specific metastasis. We used spontaneous and implant models of metastatic mammary carcinoma coupled with inflammatory tissue fibrosis, single-cell sequencing analyses and functional studies to unravel the causal determinants of organ-specific metastasis. Here we show that lung metastasis is facilitated by angiopoietin 2 (Ang2)-mediated suppression of lung-specific endothelial tight junction protein Claudin 5, which is augmented by the inflammatory fibrotic microenvironment and prevented by anti-Ang2 blocking antibodies, while kidney metastasis is prevented by non-Ang2-responsive Claudins 2 and 10. Suppression of Claudins 2 and 10 was sufficient to induce the emergence of kidney metastasis. This study illustrates the influence of organ-specific vascular heterogeneity in determining organotropic metastasis, independent of cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms.",
Basal-to-inflammatory transition and tumor resistance via crosstalk with a pro-inflammatory stromal niche,"Nancy Yanzhe Li, Weiruo Zhang, Daniel Haensel, Anna R. Jussila, Cory Pan, Sadhana Gaddam, Sylvia K. Plevritis, Anthony E. Oro",2024-09-17,"Cancer-associated inflammation is a double-edged sword possessing both pro- and anti-tumor properties through ill-defined tumor-immune dynamics. While we previously identified a carcinoma tumor-intrinsic resistance pathway, basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition, here, employing a multipronged single-cell and spatial-omics approach, we identify an inflammation and therapy-enriched tumor state we term basal-to-inflammatory transition. Basal-to-inflammatory transition signature correlates with poor overall patient survival in many epithelial tumors. Basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition and basal-to-inflammatory transition occur in adjacent but distinct regions of a single tumor: basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition arises within the core tumor nodule, while basal-to-inflammatory transition emerges from a specialized inflammatory environment defined by a tumor-associated TREM1 myeloid signature. TREM1 myeloid-derived cytokines IL1 and OSM induce basal-to-inflammatory transition in vitro and in vivo through NF-κB, lowering sensitivity of patient basal cell carcinoma explant tumors to Smoothened inhibitor treatment. This work deepens our knowledge of the heterogeneous local tumor microenvironment and nominates basal-to-inflammatory transition as a drug-resistant but targetable tumor state driven by a specialized inflammatory microenvironment.",

Here, we show an expansion of MDS hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with a granulo-monocytic-biased transcriptional differentiation state in MDS patients who initially responded to venetoclax but eventually relapsed. While MDS HSCs in an undifferentiated cellular state are sensitive to venetoclax treatment, differentiation towards a granulo-monocytic-biased transcriptional state, through the acquisition or expansion of clones with STAG2 or RUNX1 mutations, affects HSCs’ survival dependence from BCL2-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways to TNFα-induced pro-survival NF-κB signaling and drives resistance to venetoclax-mediated cytotoxicity. Our findings reveal how hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) can eventually overcome therapy-induced depletion and underscore the importance of using close molecular monitoring to prevent HSPC hierarchical change in MDS patients enrolled in clinical trials of venetoclax.",
Genetic features and therapeutic relevance of emergent circulating tumor DNA alterations in refractory non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers,"David Hsiehchen, Leslie Bucheit, Dong Yang, Muhammad Shaalan Beg, Mir Lim, Sunyoung S. Lee, Pashtoon Murtaza Kasi, Ahmed O. Kaseb, Hao Zhu",2022-12-03,"Acquired resistance to systemic treatments is inevitable in most cancers, but the genetic basis for this in many cancer types has remained elusive due to constraints in obtaining tissue specimens longitudinally. In the management of gastrointestinal cancers, molecular profiling is conventionally performed at a single time point, although serial evaluations may yield biological insights that inform treatment decisions. We characterize genetic changes in serial liquid biopsies which provide real-time snapshots of tumor genetics and heterogeneity in refractory non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers, and determine the clinical utility of repeat circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing. In a national cohort of 449 patients with pancreatic, biliary, esophagogastric, and hepatocellular cancers, resistance to conventional therapies is broadly associated with tumor evolution. Emergent ctDNA alterations only detectable at progression occurs in 63% of patients and are frequently associated with treatment actionability. Tumor mutation burden is dynamic in cancers undergoing treatment, but is not associated with time to progression. Objective tumor responses in a case series of patients receiving treatment matched to emergent alterations show that repeat liquid biopsies may have clinical benefit by expanding treatment options in advanced gastrointestinal cancers.",
Optimizing focused very-high-energy electron beams for radiation therapy based on Monte Carlo simulation,"Chaofan An, Wei Zhang, Zeyi Dai, Jia Li, Xiong Yang, Jike Wang, Yuancun Nie",2024-11-11,"A TOPAS-based optimization program has been developed to precisely concentrate the dose of focused very-high-energy electron (VHEE) beams on deep-seated targets. This is accomplished by optimizing the magnetic gradients, positions, and number of quadrupole magnets within TOPAS. Using only three quadrupole magnets, the program focuses 250 MeV VHEE beams to achieve a maximum dose position deeper than 17 cm, while maintaining entrance and exit doses within 25% and limiting the lateral dimensions to ≤ 1 cm at the maximum dose location. The linear relationship between the magnetic gradient of the last quadrupole magnet and the maximum dose position enables dose location adjustments through gradient variation. Multiple positions were validated in TOPAS with errors within 1%. The spread-out electron peak (SOEP) is achieved by combining two VHEE beams with different maximum dose positions using the differential evolution method, covering a target depth of 12–17 cm and attaining a dose flatness better than 99%. This pioneering program imposes constraints on entrance dose, exit dose, maximum dose position, and the lateral dimensions of dose deposition at the maximum dose position within phantom. This program may be a promising tool in the applications of focused VHEE in highly conformal treatment plans based on TOPAS.","Focused VHEE, FLASH-radiotherapy, Spread-out electron peak (SOEP)"
Spatial transcriptomics reveals strong association between SFRP4 and extracellular matrix remodeling in prostate cancer,"Maria K. Andersen, Sebastian Krossa, Elise Midtbust, Christine A.

Rye, May-Britt Tessem",2024-11-08,"Prostate tumor heterogeneity is a major obstacle when studying the biological mechanisms of molecular markers. Increased gene expression levels of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is a biomarker in aggressive prostate cancer. To understand how SFRP4 relates to prostate cancer we performed comprehensive spatial and multiomics analysis of the same prostate cancer tissue samples. The experimental workflow included spatial transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics, proteomics, DNA methylomics and tissue staining. SFRP4 mRNA was predominantly located in cancer stroma, produced by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, and co-expressed with extracellular matrix components. We also confirmed that higher SFRP4 gene expression is associated with cancer aggressiveness. Gene expression of SFRP4 was affected by gene promotor methylation. Surprisingly, the high mRNA levels did not reflect SFRP4 protein levels, which was much lower. This study contributes previously unknown insights of SFRP4 mRNA in the prostate tumor environment that potentially can improve diagnosis and treatment.",

Here we select a novel human CD40 agonistic drug candidate and generate a bispecific antibody, herein named BiA9*2_HF, that allows for rapid antibody-peptide conjugate formation. The format is designed to facilitate peptide antigen delivery to CD40 expressing cells combined with simultaneous CD40 agonistic activity. In vivo, the selected bispecific antibody BiA9*2_HF loaded with peptide cargos induces improved antigen-specific proliferation of CD8+ (10-15 fold) and CD4+ T cells (2-7 fold) over control in draining lymph nodes. In both virus-induced and neoantigen-based mouse tumor models, BiA9*2_HF demonstrates therapeutic efficacy and elevated safety profile, with complete tumor clearance, as well as measured abscopal impact on tumor growth. The BiA9*2_HF drug candidate can thus be utilized to tailor immunotherapeutics for cancer patients.",
Inhibition of GPX4 enhances CDK4/6 inhibitor and endocrine therapy activity in breast cancer,"M. T. Herrera-Abreu, J. Guan, U. Khalid, J. Ning, M. R. Costa, J. Chan, Q. Li, J-P. Fortin, W. R.

Turner",2024-11-05,"CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with endocrine therapy is the standard of care for estrogen receptor (ER+) breast cancer, and although cytostasis is frequently observed, new treatment strategies that enhance efficacy are required. Here, we perform two independent genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify genetic determinants of CDK4/6 and endocrine therapy sensitivity. Genes involved in oxidative stress and ferroptosis modulate sensitivity, with GPX4 as the top sensitiser in both screens. Depletion or inhibition of GPX4 increases sensitivity to palbociclib and giredestrant, and their combination, in ER+ breast cancer models, with GPX4 null xenografts being highly sensitive to palbociclib. GPX4 perturbation additionally sensitises triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) models to palbociclib. Palbociclib and giredestrant induced oxidative stress and disordered lipid metabolism, leading to a ferroptosis-sensitive state. Lipid peroxidation is promoted by a peroxisome AGPAT3-dependent pathway in ER+ breast cancer models, rather than the classical ACSL4 pathway. Our data demonstrate that CDK4/6 and ER inhibition creates vulnerability to ferroptosis induction, that could be exploited through combination with GPX4 inhibitors, to enhance sensitivity to the current therapies in breast cancer.",
Safety and aesthetic evaluation of autologous dermal fat grafts for lateral Skull base defect reconstruction,"Xu Tian, Yu Huang, Zhiqiang Gao, Yang Zhao, Liqin Zhang, Huiying Sun, Guodong Feng, Yu Chen",2024-11-09,"ObjectiveThe selection of appropriate materials and techniques for reconstructing skull base defects is crucial for restoring function, minimizing complications, and enhancing aesthetics. Dermal fat grafts (DFGs) have been established in many surgeries for contour correction. However, there is little literature describing the application of free dermal fat grafts for reconstruction of lateral skull base surgery defects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effect of using free dermal fat grafts in the reconstruction of lateral skull base defects.MethodsIn this study, 32 patients who underwent primary autologous free dermal fat graft reconstruction for lateral skull base defects were enrolled. Postoperative complications both in the donor and recipient area were evaluated. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques were applied to visualize the fat graft shape and volume variations for the assessment of postoperative restoring function. A telephone questionnaire was used for the assessment of postoperative facial aesthetics and patient satisfaction.ResultsA total of 32 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study, showing satisfying results in safety and aesthetics. Participants’ ages averaged at 42.03 years, with the youngest being 18 and the oldest at 75 years old. No patient had postoperative complications of abdominal wounds in the donor area, only two patients had postoperative infections and one patient had a postoperative effusion in the recipient area. The volume of the grafts ranged from a minimum of 24.4 cm³ to a maximum of 131 cm³, with the highest recorded resorption volume being 33.63 cm³. The average resorption rate of the dermal fat graft was 24.36%, ranging from a minimum of 11% to a maximum of 43%. 3D reconstruction based on MRI imaging data indicated that DFGs have a lower resorption rate than traditional free fat grafts. The telephone questionnaire revealed high patient satisfaction with facial aesthetics, with the majority rating their outcomes positively.ConclusionsDermal fat grafts have fewer complication and can provide better resistance to infection and radiation aspect. Based on 3D reconstruction techniques via MRI imaging data, we found that dermal fat grafts have lower resorption rate than traditional free fat grafts, which can be a suitable material for reconstruction of lateral skull base defects.","Lateral skull base defect, Fat graft, Reconstructive surgery, 3D reconstruction"
Evaluation of thermal effects of surgical energy devices: ex vivo study,"Toshiharu Morikawa, Shuzo Hamamoto, Masakazu Gonda, Kazumi Taguchi, Rei Unno, Koei Torii, Masahiko Isogai, Kengo Kawase, Takashi Nagai, Shoichiro Iwatsuki, Toshiki Etani, Taku Naiki, Atsushi Okada, Takahiro Yasui",2024-11-09,"This study evaluated the direct and indirect thermal effects of various surgical energy devices using an ex-vivo model. Two types of three devices were evaluated: ENSEAL™ X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer (X1) and ENSEAL™ G2 Curved Tissue Sealer (G2) as vessel sealing systems (VSSs), and HARMONIC® HD1000i Shears (HA) as an ultrasonic activating device (USAD). Each device was activated once under DRY or WET conditions. The tissue’s maximum temperature (MT), steam MT surrounding the activation site, and steam spread area (SSA) were measured. Under WET conditions, the median MT of a porcine common carotid artery at 1 mm from the activation site by X1, G2, and HA were 84.4, 83.3, and 50.5 °C, respectively. The direct thermal effect of HA was the lowest among the three devices. VSSs showed higher tissue MT under WET conditions compared with DRY conditions. Conversely, USAD showed the opposite trend. G2 demonstrated a significantly higher MT than X1 and HA (P < 0.05). A significant decrease in SSA was observed with decreasing grasping range. In conclusion, VSSs generated higher temperatures than USAD, especially under WET conditions. Surgeons should consider minimizing thermal effects by creating DRY conditions or performing gradual incisions when using VSS devices.","Vessel sealing system, Ultrasonic activating device, Thermal effect, Grasping range, Steam spread area, WET condition"
Identifying key circulating tumor DNA parameters for predicting clinical outcomes in metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer after first-line chemoimmunotherapy,"Haolun Ding, Min Yuan, Yaning Yang, Xu Steven Xu",2024-08-10,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provides valuable tumor-related information without invasive biopsies, yet consensus is lacking on optimal parameters for predicting clinical outcomes. Utilizing longitudinal ctDNA data from the large phase 3 IMpower150 study (NCT02366143) of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in patients with stage IV non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), here we report that post-treatment ctDNA response correlates significantly with radiographic response. However, only modest concordance is identified, revealing that ctDNA response is likely not a surrogate for radiographic response; both provide distinct information. Various ctDNA metrics, especially early ctDNA nadirs, emerge as primary predictors for progression-free survival and overall survival, potentially better assessing long-term benefits for chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC. Integrating radiographic and ctDNA assessments enhances prediction of survival outcomes. We also identify optimal cutoff values for risk stratification and key assessment timepoints, notably Weeks 6–9, for insights into clinical outcomes. Overall, our identified optimal ctDNA parameters can enhance the prediction of clinical outcomes, refine trial designs, and inform therapeutic decisions for first-line NSCLC patients.",
Late-line options for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a review and evidence-based algorithm,"Paolo Ciracì, Vittorio Studiale, Ada Taravella, Carlotta Antoniotti, Chiara Cremolini",2024-11-18,"Over the past few years, several novel systemic treatments have emerged for patients with treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, thus making selection of the most effective later-line therapy a challenge for medical oncologists. Over the past decade, regorafenib and trifluridine–tipiracil were the only available drugs and often provided limited clinical benefit compared to best supportive care. Results from subsequent practice-changing trials opened several novel therapeutic avenues, both for unselected patients (such as trifluridine–tipiracil plus bevacizumab or fruquintinib) and for subgroups defined by the presence of actionable alterations in their tumours (such as HER2-targeted therapies or KRASG12C inhibitors) or with no acquired mechanisms of resistance to the previously received targeted agents in circulating tumour DNA (such as retreatment with anti-EGFR antibodies). In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of advances in the field over the past few years and offer a practical perspective on translation of the most relevant results into the daily management of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer using an evidence-based algorithm. Finally, we discuss some of the most appealing ongoing areas of research and highlight approaches with the potential to further expand the therapeutic armamentarium.",

Impact of renal impairment on early development of severe neutropenia with trifluridine/tipiracil treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer,"Yoshitaka Saito, Yoh Takekuma, Yoshito Komatsu, Mitsuru Sugawara",2024-11-06,"Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) with or without bevacizumab is an effective treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). As this agent is mainly excreted via the kidney, we aimed to evaluate the impact of renal impairment (RI) on the early development of severe neutropenia, a dose-limiting toxicity and whose development reflects better treatment outcomes, in patients with mCRC treated with FTD/TPI. Patients with mCRC receiving FTD/TPI ± bevacizumab (n = 100) were divided into the RI group (creatinine clearance [CCr] < 90 mL/min) or control group (CCr ≥ 90 mL/min), and retrospectively evaluated. Severe neutropenia during the first two cycles occurred in 57.6% and 34.2% of patients in the RI and control groups, respectively, which was significantly different (P = 0.03) and met our primary endpoint. Furthermore, the incidence during the first cycle also differed significantly (52.5% in the RI group and 17.1% in the control group, P = 0.0004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that baseline RI and neutropenia were significant risk factors for early severe neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 3.07, 1.24–7.59, P = 0.02 for RI, and 9.76, 1.08–88.11, P = 0.04 for neutropenia). In conclusion, our study suggested that patients with RI can exhibit early severe neutropenia during real-world FTD/TPI treatment for mCRC.","Trifluridine/tipiracil, Renal impairment, Severe neutropenia, Bevacizumab, Risk factor"
Detection of IDH mutation in glioma by desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) tandem mass spectrometry,"Mahdiyeh Shahi, Steven Pringle, Michael Morris, Diogo Moniz Garcia, Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa, R. Graham Cooks",2024-11-06,"Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS) is used to assess mutation status of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in human gliomas. Due to the diffuse nature of gliomas, total gross resection is not normally achieved during surgery, leading to tumor recurrence. The mutation status of IDH has clinical significance due to better prognosis in IDH-mutant patients. The mutant IDH converts alpha-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which accumulates abnormally in cells. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and genetic testing, the gold standards, are incompatible with intraoperative applications but DESI tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can be used to assess the mutation status of IDH enzyme from tissue intraoperatively. Here, on off-line evaluation is made of the performance of two different types of mass spectrometers in characterization of IDH mutation status. The intensity of 2HG is measured against glutamate (Glu), an intrinsic reference molecule, in both tandem MS measurements. In both cases using DESI clear separation between IDH-mutant (mut) and IDH-wildtype (wt) samples (p < 0.0001) is observed, despite the short analysis time. Due to the higher detection sensitivity, multiple reaction monitoring experiments using a triple quadrupole show slightly better performance compared to product ion MS/MS performed on a simple linear ion trap. Both DESI-MS platforms are capable of providing information on IDH mutation status, which might in future be used at the time of surgery to support decision-making on resection regions, especially at tumor margins.","Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), 2-hydroxyglutarate, Oncometabolite, Molecular diagnostics, Brain cancer, Ambient ionization"

However, most studies on BU/CY conditioning regimens were conducted before proteasome inhibitors (PIs) and immunomodulatory drugs (IMIDs) were available. This non-interventional comparative cohort study compared progression-free survival (PFS) between the MEL-200 and BU/CY in patients with MM treated with PIs and/or IMIDs. A total of 137 patients were analyzed (MEL-200,113 patients; BU/CY, 24 patients). The BU/CY group had a higher rate of PI and/or IMID use and very good partial response (VGPR) or complete remission (CR) at ASCT and post-ASCT maintenance. Median PFS was 29.7 and 46.8 months in the MEL-200 and BU/CY groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, PFS was significantly better in the BU/CY group. International Staging System Stage I and VGPR or CR at ASCT were significantly associated with longer PFS. No treatment-related mortality was observed in either group by day 100. The BU/CY conditioning regimen may be a viable alternative to the MEL-200 regimen in patients with MM who undergo ASCT after treatment with PIs and/or IMIDs.","Multiple myeloma, Autologous stem cell transplantation, Melphalan, Busulfan, Cyclophosphamide"
Prostaglandin E2-EP2/EP4 signaling induces immunosuppression in human cancer by impairing bioenergetics and ribosome biogenesis in immune cells,"Siwakorn Punyawatthananukool, Ryuma Matsuura, Thamrong Wongchang, Nao Katsurada, Tatsuaki Tsuruyama, Masaki Tajima, Yutaka Enomoto, Toshio Kitamura, Masahiro Kawashima, Masakazu Toi, Koji Yamanoi, Junzo Hamanishi, Shigeo Hisamori, Kazutaka Obama, Varodom Charoensawan, Dean Thumkeo, Shuh Narumiya",2024-11-01,"While prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is produced in human tumor microenvironment (TME), its role therein remains poorly understood. Here, we examine this issue by comparative single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells infiltrating human cancers and syngeneic tumors in female mice. PGE receptors EP4 and EP2 are expressed in lymphocytes and myeloid cells, and their expression is associated with the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and MYC targets, glycolysis and ribosomal proteins (RPs). Mechanistically, CD8+ T cells express EP4 and EP2 upon TCR activation, and PGE2 blocks IL-2-STAT5 signaling by downregulating Il2ra, which downregulates c-Myc and PGC-1 to decrease OXPHOS, glycolysis, and RPs, impairing migration, expansion, survival, and antitumor activity. Similarly, EP4 and EP2 are induced upon macrophage activation, and PGE2 downregulates c-Myc and OXPHOS in M1-like macrophages. These results suggest that PGE2-EP4/EP2 signaling impairs both adaptive and innate immunity in TME by hampering bioenergetics and ribosome biogenesis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.",
The association between breast cancer and lung cancer: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study,"Xiaoqian Li, Junjie Liu, Jingyi Zhang, Yidi Wang, Jianjun He, Huimin Zhang",2024-11-06,"With increasing life spans, breast cancer (BC) survivors may face the possibility of developing second primary cancer (SPC), which can considerably shorten survival. Lung cancer (LC) is a common SPC among BC survivors. This study explored the association between these two cancers through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. A bidirectional two-sample MR analysis was conducted with BC genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) included 228,951 individuals and the GWAS summary statistics from the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) of LC included 112,781 individuals. The IVW method and MR-RAPS method showed a causal effect of overall BC on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (IVW: OR = 1.060, 95% CI = 1.008–1.116, P = 0.024; MR-RAPS: OR = 1.059, 95% CI = 1.005–1.116, P = 0.033), which indicated that patients with BC had an increased risk of LUAD. However, there is no strong evidence for a causal effect of LUAD on BC. Our study revealed a causal effect of BC on second primary LUAD, suggesting that we should intensify screening for second primary LC in BC survivors. Early intervention and treatment for patients with second primary LC are needed to reduce mortality in BC survivors.","Breast cancer, Lung cancer, Mendelian randomization, Causal effect"
53BP1 loss elicits cGAS-STING-dependent antitumor immunity in ovarian and pancreatic cancer,"Yajie Sun, Jeffrey Patterson-Fortin, Sen Han, Zhe Li, Zuzanna Nowicka, Yuna Hirohashi, Susan Kilgas, Jae Kyo Yi, Alexander Spektor, Wojciech Fendler, Panagiotis A. Konstantinopoulos, Dipanjan Chowdhury",2024-08-06,"53BP1 nucleates the anti-end resection machinery at DNA double-strand breaks, thereby countering BRCA1 activity. Loss of 53BP1 leads to DNA end processing and homologous recombination in BRCA1-deficient cells. Consequently, BRCA1-mutant tumors, typically sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), become resistant in the absence of 53BP1. Here, we demonstrate that the ‘leaky’ DNA end resection in the absence of 53BP1 results in increased micronuclei and cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA, leading to activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and pro-inflammatory signaling. This enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration, activates macrophages and natural killer cells, and impedes tumor growth. Loss of 53BP1 correlates with a response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and improved overall survival. Immunohistochemical assessment of 53BP1 in two malignancies, high grade serous ovarian cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which are refractory to ICBs, reveals that lower 53BP1 levels correlate with an increased adaptive and innate immune response. Finally, BRCA1-deficient tumors that develop resistance to PARPi due to the loss of 53BP1 are susceptible to ICB. Therefore, we conclude that 53BP1 is critical for tumor immunogenicity and underpins the response to ICB. Our results support including 53BP1 expression as an exploratory biomarker in ICB trials for malignancies typically refractory to immunotherapy.",

Secondary endpoints demonstrated sustained clinical responses, favorable pharmacokinetic parameters and a 6-month progression-free survival of 82%. Vactosertib combined with pomalidomide was well-tolerated at all dose levels and displayed a manageable adverse event profile. Exploratory analysis indicated that vactosertib co-treatment with pomalidomide also reduced TGFβ levels in patient bone marrow as well as the level of CD8+ T-cells that expressed the immunoinhibitory marker PD-1. In vitro experiments indicated that vactosertib+pomalidomide co-treatment decreased the viability of MM cell lines and patient tumor cells, and increased CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity. Vactosertib is a safe therapeutic that demonstrates tumor-intrinsic activity and can overcome immunosuppressive challenges within the tumor microenvironment to reinvigorate T-cell fitness. Vactosertib offers promise to improve immunotherapeutic responses in heavily-pretreated MM patients refractory to conventional agents.",
A novel small molecule Enpp1 inhibitor improves tumor control following radiation therapy by targeting stromal Enpp1 expression,"Jason R Baird, Alejandro F Alice, Roland Saito, Qingqing Chai, Minhua Han, Cindy Ng, Stephanie Han, Beth Fernandez, Sarah Ledoux, Johannes Grosse, Alan J Korman, Megan Potuznik, Venkatesh Rajamanickam, Brady Bernard, Marka R Crittenden, Michael J Gough",2024-12-02,"The uniqueness in each person’s cancer cells and variation in immune infiltrates means that each tumor represents a unique problem, but therapeutic targets can be found among their shared features. Radiation therapy alters the interaction between the cancer cells and the stroma through release of innate adjuvants. The extranuclear DNA that can result from radiation damage of cells can result in production of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). In turn, cGAMP can activate the innate sensor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), resulting in innate immune activation. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (Enpp1) is a phosphodiesterase that can be expressed by cancer cells that can degrade cGAMP, thus can decrease or block STING activation following radiation therapy, impairing the innate immunity that is critical to support adaptive immune control of tumors. We observed that many human and murine cancer cells lack Enpp1 expression, but that Enpp1 is expressed in cells of the tumor stroma where it limits tumor control by radiation therapy. We demonstrate in preclinical models the efficacy of a novel Enpp1 inhibitor and show that this inhibitor improves tumor control by radiation even where the cancer cells lack Enpp1. This mechanism requires STING and type I interferon (IFN) receptor expression by non-cancer cells and is dependent on CD8 T cells as a final effector mechanism of tumor control. This suggests that Enpp1 inhibition may be an effective partner for radiation therapy regardless of whether cancer cells express Enpp1. This broadens the potential patient base for whom Enpp1 inhibitors can be applied to improve innate immune responses following radiation therapy.",

RNA isolation from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples was performed using the Promega ReliaPrep RNA Miniprep System, facilitating gene amplification relevant to cancer through the Archer® FusionPlexComprehensiveThyroid and Lung (CTL) kit. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina NextSeq platform enabled comprehensive analysis of target areas. Utilizing Archer Analysis software, secondary analyses involving data cleansing, alignment, and variant/fusion identification were executed against the human reference genome hg19 (GRCh37). Expression patterns were visualized using HeatMap graphics. Our findings revealed a notable presence of KRAS gene mutations in approximately 20% of NSCLC patients. Among these mutations, the G12C variant was predominant at 50%, followed by G12V and G12D variants at 11.2% each. Notably, patients harboring the G12C variant responded favorably to sotorasib medication. These results underscore the importance of mutational profiling and targeted therapeutic approaches in managing NSCLC, particularly highlighting the promising efficacy of sotorasib in G12C-mutated cases.","KRAS G12C mutation, Non-small-cell lung cancer, Sotorasib"
Radiomics analysis in differentiating osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma based on T2-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging,"Zhi Gao, Zhongshang Dai, Zhengxiao Ouyang, Dianqing Li, Sihuai Tang, Penglin Li, Xudong Liu, Yongfang Jiang, Deye Song",2024-11-04,"This study was performed to investigate the diagnostic value of radiomics models constructed by fat suppressed T2-weighted imaging (T2WI-FS) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CET1) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for differentiation of osteosarcoma (OS) and chondrosarcoma (CS). In this retrospective cohort study, we included all inpatients with pathologically confirmed OS or CS from Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Hunan, China) as of October 2020. Demographic and imaging variables were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between OS and CS group. Totals of 530 radiomics features were extracted from CET1 and T2WI-FS sequences based on MRI. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for screening and dimensionality reduction of the radiomics model. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to construct the radiomics model, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the radiomics model. The training cohort and validation cohort included 87 and 29 patients, respectively. 8 CET1 features and 15 T2WI-FS features were screened based on the radiomics features. In the training group, the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) value for CET1 and T2WI-FS sequences in the radiomics model was 0.894 (95% CI 0.817–0.970) and 0.970 (95% CI 0.940–0.999), respectively. In the validation group, the AUC value for CET1 and T2WI-FS sequences in the radiomics model was 0.821 (95% CI 0.642–1.000) and 0.899 (95% CI 0.785–1.000), respectively.

The utilization of cytology for intraoperative diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma,"Liwen Hu, Jianqing Tang, Xiaoli Su, Limei Zheng, Chengcong Hu, Qiulin Wu, Xuefang Lin, Saifan Zeng, Yupeng Chen, Sheng Zhang, Xingfu Wang",2024-11-03,"To investigate the diagnostic value of intraoperative cytology and rapid immunocytochemistry in primary central nervous system lymphoma. 254 cases of lymphoma and 82 cases of non-lymphoma were collected from 2010 to 2023. Frozen section(FS) was using alone in 44 cases during 2010–2014, FS and intraoperative cytology(IC) were using in 251 cases during 2015 to 2022. Rapid immunocytochemical(RICC, CD20, GFAP) were using with FS + IC in 41 cases during 2021 to 2023. Method One: According to the results of archives, statistic the diagnostic accuracy of lymphoma during three time periods. Method Two: All cases were randomly renumbered, 4 neuropathologists compared the accuracy of independent histology and that of combining cytology. The archives showed the diagnostic accuracy of FS in PCNSL was 77.27%, FS + IC was 86.06%, FS + IC + RICC was 92.68%. The retrospective study demonstrated the diagnostic accuracy of FS was 79.76%, FS + IC was 87.33% and FS + IC + RICC was 92.68%. The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of CD20 were 100%, 76.92%, 90.32%, 100% and 92.68%, respectively. The results of the paired χ2 test was no statistically significant difference (0.05 < P < 0.1) between FS + IC + RICC and immunohistochemical (IHC) diagnosis of paraffin sections. The integration of IC + RICC + FS diagnosis can significantly enhance the intraoperative diagnostic accuracy of PCNSL and rectify potential errors that may occurred when relying solely on FS diagnosis.","Primary central nervous system lymphoma, Intraoperative diagnosis, Cytology, Rapid immunocytochemical staining, CD20"
Clinicopathological features of lacrimal gland biopsy lesions in 582 Chinese patients,"Lvfu He, Weimin He",2024-11-03,"Background This study was conducted to assess the clinicopathological characteristics of biopsy lesions in the lacrimal gland, in response to evolving pathological technologies and the emergence of new diseases. A retrospective review of case notes was conducted for 582 patients with biopsied lacrimal gland lesions at West China Hospital of Sichuan University in China. This study, spanning from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021, recorded demographics, clinical features, imaging findings, histopathological diagnoses, and recurrence rates. In a cohort of 582 patients, the mean age was 47.5 years, with 318 being female. Bilateral disease was present in 127 patients. Common signs and symptoms included a palpable mass, lid swelling, proptosis, and decreased ocular movements or diplopia. The predominant pathologies identified were inflammation, epithelial tumors, and lymphoproliferative lesions. Patients with inflammation (mean 32.8 months) experienced symptoms for a longer period compared to those with lymphoproliferative lesions (mean 22.2 months) (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53–19.27, P = 0.022). Younger patients tended to have structural lesions (mean 42.5 years) (95%CI 4.74–21.59, P = 0.003), inflammation (mean 42.9 years) (95%CI 0.46–6.57, P<0.001), or epithelial tumors (mean 46.4 years) (95%CI 6.21–12.38, P<0.001), while older patients more frequently had lymphoproliferative lesions (mean 55.7 years). The period from 2016 to 2021 saw a higher diagnosis rate of biopsied lacrimal gland lesions than from 2010 to 2015. During this later period, there was an increase in cases of immunoglobulin G4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD) and malignant epithelial tumors, while lymphoid hyperplasia cases declined. Adenoid cystic carcinoma showed the highest recurrence rate, with lesion extent and Ki-67 index identified as independent risk factors in our study. Inflammation, epithelial tumors, and lymphoproliferative lesions were the three primary causes of lacrimal gland lesions in our study group. Among the inflammatory conditions, IgG4-ROD was the most specific. The incidence of lacrimal gland lesions has risen, particularly for IgG4-ROD. Adenoid cystic carcinoma among the lacrimal gland lesions was prone to recurrence, with the extent of the lesion and Ki-67 index serving as independent risk factors.","Lacrimal gland, Biopsy, Histopathology, Etiologies"
Biallelic loss of BCMA as a resistance mechanism to CAR T cell therapy in a patient with multiple myeloma,"Mehmet Kemal Samur, Mariateresa Fulciniti, Anil Aktas Samur, Abdul Hamid Bazarbachi, Yu-Tzu Tai, Rao Prabhala, Alejandro Alonso, Adam S.

Munshi",2021-02-08,"BCMA targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown deep and durable responses in multiple myeloma. However, relapse following therapy is frequently observed, and mechanisms of resistance remain ill-defined. Here, we perform single cell genomic characterization of longitudinal samples from a patient who relapsed after initial CAR T cell treatment with lack of response to retreatment. We report selection, following initial CAR T cell infusion, of a clone with biallelic loss of BCMA acquired by deletion of one allele and a mutation that creates an early stop codon on the second allele. This loss leads to lack of CAR T cell proliferation following the second infusion and is reflected by lack of soluble BCMA in patient serum. Our analysis suggests the need for careful detection of BCMA gene alterations in multiple myeloma cells from relapse following CAR T cell therapy.",
Fn-OMV potentiates ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis triggered by oncolytic HSV-1 to fuel antitumor immunity,"Shuo Wang, An Song, Jun Xie, Yuan-Yuan Wang, Wen-Da Wang, Meng-Jie Zhang, Zhi-Zhong Wu, Qi-Chao Yang, Hao Li, Junjie Zhang, Zhi-Jun Sun",2024-04-30,"Oncolytic viruses (OVs) show promise as a cancer treatment by selectively replicating in tumor cells and promoting antitumor immunity. However, the current immunogenicity induced by OVs for tumor treatment is relatively weak, necessitating a thorough investigation of the mechanisms underlying its induction of antitumor immunity. Here, we show that HSV-1-based OVs (oHSVs) trigger ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis (a unique innate immune inflammatory cell death modality), resulting in augmented antitumor immune effects. Mechanistically, oHSV enhances the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, leading to the accumulation of endogenous Z-RNA and subsequent activation of ZBP1. To further enhance the antitumor potential of oHSV, we conduct a screening and identify Fusobacterium nucleatum outer membrane vesicle (Fn-OMV) that can increase the expression of PANoptosis execution proteins. The combination of Fn-OMV and oHSV demonstrates potent antitumor immunogenicity. Taken together, our study provides a deeper understanding of oHSV-induced antitumor immunity, and demonstrates a promising strategy that combines oHSV with Fn-OMV.",

We applied cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) ctDNA analysis to 218 samples from 65 patients receiving chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, including 28 patients receiving consolidation immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Patients with undetectable ctDNA after chemoradiation therapy had excellent outcomes whether or not they received consolidation ICI. Among such patients, one died from consolidation ICI-related pneumonitis, highlighting the potential utility of only treating patients with MRD. In contrast, patients with MRD after chemoradiation therapy who received consolidation ICI had significantly better outcomes than patients who did not receive consolidation ICI. Furthermore, the ctDNA response pattern early during consolidation ICI identified patients responding to consolidation therapy. Our results suggest that consolidation ICI improves outcomes for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with MRD and that ctDNA analysis may facilitate personalization of consolidation therapy.",
Molecular imaging of renal cell carcinomas: ready for prime time,"Qianyun Wu, Hongda Shao, Wei Zhai, Gang Huang, Jianjun Liu, Jeremie Calais, Weijun Wei",2024-11-14,"The clinical diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is constantly evolving. Diagnostic imaging of RCC relying on enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for renal mass characterization and assessment of tumour thrombosis, whereas pathology is the gold standard for establishing diagnosis. However, molecular imaging is rapidly improving the clinical management of RCC, particularly clear-cell RCC. Molecular imaging aids in the non-invasive visualization and characterization of specific biomarkers such as carbonic anhydrase IX and CD70 within the tumours, which help to assess tumour heterogeneity and status. Target-specific molecular imaging of RCCs will substantially improve the diagnostic landscape of RCC and will further facilitate clinical decision-making regarding initial staging and re-staging, monitoring of recurrence and metastasis, patient stratification and selection, and the prediction and evaluation of treatment responses.",
Differences in axillary response and treatment implications in HER2 positive node positive breast cancer during neoadjuvant HER2 targeted dual therapy,"Exian Mou, Juan Ji, Shiwei Liu, Lan Shu, Liqun Zou, Zhuoxuan Li",2024-11-01,"Explore whether the axillary outcomes differ among HER2 positive subgroups receiving standard dual-targeted therapy, aiming to identify subgroups exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to NAT among HER2-positive/node-positive breast cancer patients. HER2 positive female patients with biopsy-proven node-positive disease from April 2020 to May 2023 were included. All patients underwent standard Neoadjuvant HER2-targeted dual therapy and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) at Breast Surgery Center of Sichuan Cancer Hospital. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associate with axillary pathological complete response (ApCR). Statistical analysis and graphing were performed using SPSS 24.0 and GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. This study enrolled 215 HER2 positive patients with a total ApCR rate of 76.7%, which included 49 HER2 2+/FISH + and 166 HER2 3 + cases with approximate ApCR rates of 63.3% and 80.7% (P = 0.011). Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that HER2 3 + disease (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.21–4.88, P = 0.012), Ki-67 ≥ 20% disease (OR = 3.00, 95% CI 1.26–7.13, P = 0.013) and NAC regimen of TCb (OR = 2.71, 95% CI 1.39–5.38, P = 0.004) were more likely to achieve ApCR. Further subgroup analysis revealed that HER2 3 + patients receiving TCb regimen showed the highest ApCR rate of 88% compared to other subgroups. HER2 3 + breast cancer had a higher ApCR rate than HER2 2+/FISH + breast cancer during Neoadjuvant HER2-targeted dual therapy.

Construction and validation of prognostic models for young cervical cancer patients: age stratification based on restricted cubic splines,"Yuan Gong, Feifei  Gou, Qingfeng Qin, Weijie Tian, Wei Zhao, Dan Zi",2024-11-30,"Cervical cancer (CC) ranks as the second highest cause of morbidity and mortality among young women; however, there are currently no age-specific definitions for young cervical cancer or prognostic models tailored to this demographic. Data on CC diagnosed between 2000 and 2019 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Age stratification is based on the relationship between age and cancer-specific mortality, as demonstrated by restricted cubic spline analyses (RCS). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were employed to identify independent prognostic factors in the young CC group. Two novel nomograms for this population were developed and validated using an external validation cohort obtained from a local hospital database, evaluated with concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to compare the accuracy of the established models against the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system (2018). A total of 27,658 patients from the SEER database were classified into three age groups (<36 years, 36-60 years, >60 years) based on RCS analyses, with 4,990, 16,922, and 5,746 patients in each group, respectively. The independent prognostic factors identified for young CC included stage, tumour size, grade, histologic type, and surgical intervention. The results of the C-index and calibration in both the training and validation sets confirmed that the two nomograms can accurately predict the occurrence and prognosis of young CC patients. The area under the curve (AUC) values indicated that these models demonstrated higher efficacy in predicting overall survival (OS) compared to the FIGO staging system (2018). These models could potentially serve as effective tools for clinicians to estimate the prognosis of young CC patients.",
Long-term outcomes and prognostic factors of metastatic or recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: a 20-year review in a single institution,"Fumio Ishizaki, Takahiro Taguchi, Masaki Murata, Sayaka Hoshino, Tomotaka Toba, Keisuke Takeda, Masayuki Tasaki, Kazutoshi Yamana, Takashi Kasahara, Tatsuhiko Hoshii, Kenji Obara, Kazuhide Saito, Yoshihiko Tomita",2024-11-02,"Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) represent a group of rare neuroendocrine tumors known for their potential to metastasize. This study provides a comprehensive retrospective evaluation of 15 patients diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent PPGL at our institution over a two-decade span (2000–2020). Our primary objectives were to delineate the long-term clinical outcomes and pinpoint key prognostic determinants. Median duration from initial PPGL diagnosis to the onset of metastasis or recurrence stood at 5.8 years. Predominant sites for metastasis included the bone, lung, lymph nodes, and peritoneum. A salient finding was that surgical interventions targeting metastatic lesions significantly improved prognosis. Further analysis revealed that a Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal Gland Scaled Score (PASS) exceeding 7 closely associated with unfavorable outcomes. These insights not only underscore the clinical variability of PPGL’s progression but also highlight the pivotal role of surgical management for metastatic or recurrent cases. The value of the PASS score as an informative prognostic tool was evident, suggesting its utility in shaping future therapeutic approaches. Given the intricacies of PPGL, collaborative studies involving larger patient cohorts will be crucial to optimize management strategies and prognostication.",
"The relationship between immune cells and prostate cancer, and the mediating role of metabolites: a Mendelian randomization study","Xipeng Wu, Wenda Zou, Ziwei Liu",2024-10-31,"Research has demonstrated the significant involvement of immune cells in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the precise causal relationship between immune cells and PCa remains unclear. This study utilized bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal link between immune cells and PCa. Additionally, employed mediation MR design to ascertain the potential mediating role of metabolites in the connection between immune cells and PCa outcomes. Unswitched memory B cell % lymphocyte and CD24 + CD27 + B cell % lymphocyte were positively related to PCa risk, while CD62L − monocyte absolute count and CD62L − monocyte % monocyte were negatively associated with PCa risk. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to validate these results. The mediation MR results indicate that 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoate (CMPF) levels may be an independent risk factor for PCa, while the succinate to acetoacetate ratio (SA ratio) was found to be a mediator for the effect of CD62L − monocyte % monocyte on PCa, with a mediation proportion of 16.6% (mediation percentage: 16.6%, 95%CI − 163% − 196%). The research validates the genetic causality between particular immune cells and PCa, and has emphasized the potential intermediary function of SA ratio. These noteworthy discoveries provide fresh perspectives for the clinical management of PCa.","Immune cells, Prostate cancer, Mendelian randomization, Metabolites, Mediator"
Risk factors for local recurrence following marginal mandibulectomy in gingival cancer,"Olof Nilsson, Mathias von Beckerath, Johan Knutsson, Anders Magnuson, Fredrik J. Landström, Rusana Bark",2024-11-01,"Surgery is the first line of treatment in gingival cancers of the mandible, and bone resection is necessary in the majority of cases. In the less extensive surgical option, marginal mandibulectomy (MM), the mandibular base is preserved. In contrast, in a segmental mandibulectomy (SM) the mandible is divided and the continuity is not preserved. If MM can be performed with comparable oncological results to SM, it is the preferred method. The aim of the present study was to identify preoperative predictors for local recurrence (LR), to support the selection of candidates for MM. Outcome measures were local recurrence free survival (LRFS) and disease specific survival (DSS). 67 patients treated with MM between 2008 and 2021 were included. Cox regression analyses of LR with hazard ratios and adjustments for postoperative radiotherapy, pathological T-stage (pT) and soft tissue margins were performed. 5-years LRFS was 63% (95% CI 46.9–75.5) and DSS 80.6% (95% CI 64.7–89.9). In conclusion we found that edentulous patients, more advanced pT-stage and positive soft tissue margins had increased risk for LR. Future studies of the correlation between cT and pT would be important to provide more robust preoperative support in the selection between MM and SM.","Marginal mandibulectomy, Gingival cancer, Local recurrence, Gingival neoplasm"
Low-pass whole genome sequencing of circulating tumor cells to evaluate chromosomal instability in triple-negative breast cancer,"Serena Di Cosimo, Marco Silvestri, Cinzia De Marco, Alessia Calzoni, Maria Carmen De Santis, Maria Grazia Carnevale, Carolina Reduzzi, Massimo Cristofanilli, Vera Cappelletti",2024-09-03,"Chromosomal Instability (CIN) is a common and evolving feature in breast cancer. Large-scale Transitions (LSTs), defined as chromosomal breakages leading to gains or losses of at least 10 Mb, have recently emerged as a metric of CIN due to their standardized definition across platforms. Herein, we report the feasibility of using low-pass Whole Genome Sequencing to assess LSTs, copy number alterations (CNAs) and their relationship in individual circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Initial assessment of LSTs in breast cancer cell lines consistently showed wide-ranging values (median 22, range 4–33, mean 21), indicating heterogeneous CIN. Subsequent analysis of CTCs revealed LST values (median 3, range 0–18, mean 5), particularly low during treatment, suggesting temporal changes in CIN levels. CNAs averaged 30 (range 5–49), with loss being predominant. As expected, CTCs with higher LSTs values exhibited increased CNAs. A CNA-based classifier of individual patient-derived CTCs, developed using machine learning, identified genes associated with both DNA proliferation and repair, such as RB1, MYC, and EXO1, as significant predictors of CIN. The model demonstrated a high predictive accuracy with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89. Overall, these findings suggest that sequencing CTCs holds the potential to facilitate CIN evaluation and provide insights into its dynamic nature over time, with potential implications for monitoring TNBC progression through iterative assessments.","Chromosomal instability, Large-scale transitions, Circulating tumor cells, Triple-negative breast cancer, Copy number alterations"
Radiotherapy-triggered reduction of platinum-based chemotherapeutic prodrugs in tumours,"Qunfeng Fu, Shuren Zhang, Siyong Shen, Zhi Gu, Junyi Chen, Dongfan Song, Pengwei Sun, Chunhong Wang, Zhibin Guo, Yunlong Xiao, Yi Qin Gao, Zijian Guo, Zhibo Liu",2024-07-18,"Pt(II) drugs are a widely used chemotherapeutic, yet their side effects can be severe. Here we show that the radiation-induced reduction of Pt(IV) complexes to cytotoxic Pt(II) drugs is rapid, efficient and applicable in water, that it is mediated by hydrated electrons from water radiolysis and that the X-ray-induced release of Pt(II) drugs from an oxaliplatin prodrug in tumours inhibits their growth, as we show with nearly complete tumour regression in mice with subcutaneous human tumour xenografts. The combination of low-dose radiotherapy with a Pt(IV)-based antibody–trastuzumab conjugate led to the tumour-selective release of the chemotherapeutic in mice and to substantial therapeutic benefits. The radiation-induced local reduction of platinum prodrugs in the reductive tumour microenvironment may expand the utility of radiotherapy.",

We initiated a multi-institutional single-arm phase I study (NCT02599454) enrolling twenty patients with the primary endpoint of maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy; and exploratory mechanistic correlatives. Treatment is well tolerated and full dose atezolizumab (1200 mg) is the MTD. Efficacy signals include early responses (after 2 cycles of ICI, before initiation of SABR) in 17% of patients. Biomarkers of functional adaptive immunity, including T cell activation in the tumor and response to ex-vivo stimulation by circulating T cells, are highly predictive of benefit. These results require validation and are being tested in a phase III randomized trial.",

To address this issue, we established a cohort of 434 Chinese patients with HER2-low breast cancer (433 female and one male) and integrated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling data. In this cohort, HER2-low tumors are more distinguished from HER2-0 tumors in the hormone receptor–negative subgroup. Within HER2-low tumors, significant interpatient heterogeneity also exists in the hormone receptor–negative subgroup: basal-like tumors resemble HER2-0 disease, and non-basal-like HER2-low tumors mimic HER2-positive disease. These non-basal-like HER2-low tumors are enriched in the HER2-enriched subtype and the luminal androgen receptor subtype and feature PIK3CA mutation, FGFR4/PTK6/ERBB4 overexpression and lipid metabolism activation. Among hormone receptor–positive tumors, HER2-low tumors show less loss/deletion in 17q peaks than HER2-0 tumors. In this work, we reveal the heterogeneity of HER2-low breast cancers and emphasize the need for more precise stratification regarding hormone receptor status and molecular subtype.",
Cachexia and efficiency of trifluridine/thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor + bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer,"Masatsune Shibutani, Hideki Tanda, Yuki Seki, Shinichiro Kashiwagi, Tsuyoshi Nishiyama, Yasuhiro Fukui, Daiki Imanishi, Hiroaki Kasashima, Tatsunari Fukuoka, Kiyoshi Maeda",2024-10-29,"In later-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), there may be large differences in treatment efficacy depending on cancer cachexia. Recently, the cachexia index (CXI), which was calculated from the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), serum albumin concentration, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, was developed to evaluate cancer cachexia. We retrospectively examined the CXI of 80 patients who were treated with trifluridine/thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (FTD/TPI) + bevacizumab (Bmab) therapy as a later-line treatment for mCRC, and assessed the impact of cancer cachexia on chemotherapeutic efficacy using CXI. Progression-free and overall survival rates were significantly worse in the low CXI group than in the high CXI group, although there were no marked differences in tumor factors, such as the number of metastatic organs or gene mutations, between the two groups. As the cross-sectional area of the iliopsoas muscle was significantly associated with that of the skeletal muscle, the accuracy of the CXI based on the psoas mass index (P-CXI), which is easier to calculate than the SMI, in predicting treatment outcomes was equivalent to that of the CXI based on the SMI (S-CXI). Cancer cachexia is an important factor related to treatment efficacy in later-line treatments, such as FTD/TPI + Bmab therapy.","Colorectal cancer, Cachexia, CXI, FTD/TPI, Bevacizumab"

Nine asymptomatic patients treated with a first-in-human, neoantigen DNA vaccine experienced no dose limiting toxicities (primary endpoint, NCT01209871). All patients achieve stable disease or better, with one minor response, and median time to progression of 72+ months. Post-vaccine single-cell transcriptomics reveal dichotomous antitumor responses, with reduced tumor B-cells (tracked by unique B cell receptor) and their survival pathways, but no change in clonal plasma cells. Downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules and paradoxical upregulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) by the latter suggest resistance mechanisms. Vaccine therapy activates and expands bone marrow T-cell clonotypes, and functional neoantigen-specific responses (secondary endpoint), but not co-inhibitory pathways or Treg, and reduces protumoral signaling by myeloid cells, suggesting favorable perturbation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Future strategies may require combinations of vaccines with agents targeting plasma cell subpopulations, or blockade of IGF-1 signaling or myeloid cell checkpoints.",
Association of prophylactic low-dose aspirin use with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in cancer patients,"Hui Hu, Wen-jun Chen, Zi-yi Xiong, Lin-fei Luo, Chuang Sun, Jun-ping Xie",2024-10-29,"The long-term use of aspirin for preventing cardiovascular disease has been recommended for decades. However, there is currently uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of aspirin use on the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in cancer patients. The aim of this work was to analyze the connection between the prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin and the risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and carcinoma death in carcinoma patients in the United States. A cohort study was conducted using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2011–2012, 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018) and associated mortality data. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and hazard ratios (HRs) between non-aspirin use and prophylactic low-dose aspirin use and the risk of death were measured via Cox proportional hazard regression models. A total of 1819 participants were included in the present research, of whom 945 were nonaspirin users and 874 were prophylactic aspirin users. Compared with non-aspirin users, prophylactic low-dose aspirin users had a decreased risk of all-cause death (HR = 0.647, 95% CI = 0.489–0.857). There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular death (HR = 0.623, 95% CI = 0.362–1.074) or cancer death (HR = 0.709, 95% CI = 0.410–1.226). Prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin may lower all-cause mortality in individuals with cancer but does not have a substantial effect on cardiovascular risk or cancer-specific mortality in this patient population.","NHANES, Aspirin, Cancer, Mortality"

Tumour-informed sequencing panels to monitor 30 patient-specific variants were designed and 321 liquid biopsies of 87 patients sequenced. Mean sequencing depth after deduplication using UMIs was 6000x and the error rate of UMI-corrected reads was 2.47×10−4. Variant allele fractions correlated with PET/CT MTV (rho=0.69), S100 (rho=0.72), and LDH (rho=0.54). A decrease of allele fractions between T1 and T2 was associated with improved PFS and OS in the palliative cohort (p = 0.008 and p < 0.001). ctDNA was detected in 76.9% of adjuvant patients with relapse (n = 10/13), while all patients without progression (n = 9) remained ctDNA negative.

Sanin, Varsha Vakkala, Adrianna Mendes, Christopher Bailey, Emmanuel S. Antonarakis, Channing J. Paller, Xiaojun Wu, Tamara L. Lotan, Rachel Karchin, Laura A. Sena",2024-12-02,"Metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) is not curable due to its ability to acquire therapy resistance. Theoretically, acquired therapy resistance can be driven by changes to previously sensitive cancer cells or their environment and/or by outgrowth of a subpopulation of cancer cells with primary resistance. Direct demonstration of the latter mechanism in patients with PCa is lacking. Here we present a case report as proof-of-principle that outgrowth of a subpopulation of cancer cells lacking the genomic target and present prior to therapy initiation can drive acquired resistance to targeted therapy and threaten survival in patients with PCa.",

Janeway",2024-07-11,"To inform clinical trial design and real-world precision pediatric oncology practice, we classified diagnoses, assessed the landscape of mutations, and identified genomic variants matching trials in a large unselected institutional cohort of solid tumors patients sequenced at Dana-Farber / Boston Children’s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. Tumors were sequenced with OncoPanel, a targeted next-generation DNA sequencing panel. Diagnoses were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3.2). Over 6.5 years, 888 pediatric cancer patients with 95 distinct diagnoses had successful tumor sequencing. Overall, 33% (n = 289/888) of patients had at least 1 variant matching a precision oncology trial protocol, and 14% (41/289) were treated with molecularly targeted therapy. This study highlights opportunities to use genomic data from hospital-based sequencing performed either for research or clinical care to inform ongoing and future precision oncology clinical trials. Furthermore, the study results emphasize the importance of data sharing to define the genomic landscape and targeted treatment opportunities for the large group of rare pediatric cancers we encounter in clinical practice.",
Pan-cancer analysis of the immunological and oncogenic roles of ATAD2 with verification in papillary thyroid carcinoma,"Zhecheng Li, Yaxin Zhao, Peng Huang, Zhaoyi Wu, Dengjie Ouyang, Adolphus Osei Nyarko, Lei Ai, Zhejia Zhang, Shi Chang",2024-09-27,"ATAD2 (ATPase Family AAA Domain-Containing 2) is highly expressed across varies tumor types, yet its common roles in tumor progression and immune interaction remain unclear. We analyzed the expression and alteration profiles of ATAD2, along with its diagnostic and prognostic role in pan-cancer, utilizing TCGA, GTEx, CPTAC, HPA, and cBioPortal databases. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between ATAD2 and immune infiltration utilizing single-cell sequencing data and TCGA database. Additionally, the expression and oncogenic functions of ATAD2 were verified in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) through MTT, wound-healing, transwell, and flow cytometry assays. Our results revealed significant overexpression of ATAD2 in most cancers, strongly associated with poor prognosis. Amplification was the most frequent alteration type of ATAD2, with its mutation correlating with improved overall survival. ATAD2 was positively correlated with multiple inhibitory immune checkpoints and closely associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment, particularly in PTC. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ATAD2 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PTC cells by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and modulating the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. Collectively, ATAD2 holds promise as a biomarker for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a predictor of immunotherapeutic responsiveness and a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of existing anti-tumor immune therapies.","ATAD2, Pan-cancer, Papillary thyroid carcinoma, Therapeutic target, Tumor immune microenvironment"
Glycolysis inhibition induces anti-tumor central memory CD8+T cell differentiation upon combination with microwave ablation therapy,"Xinyu Tang, Xinrui Mao, Peiwen Ling, Muxin Yu, Hua Pan, Jiaming Wang, Mingduo Liu, Hong Pan, Wen Qiu, Nan Che, Kai Zhang, Feifan Bao, Hongwei Peng, Qiang Ding, Shui Wang, Wenbin Zhou",2024-05-31,"Minimally invasive thermal therapy is a successful alternative treatment to surgery in solid tumors with high complete ablation rates, however, tumor recurrence remains a concern. Central memory CD8+ T cells (TCM) play important roles in protection from chronic infection and cancer. Here we find, by single-cell RNA analysis of human breast cancer samples, that although the memory phenotype of peripheral CD8+ T cells increases slightly after microwave ablation (MWA), the metabolism of peripheral CD8+ T cells remains unfavorable for memory phenotype. In mouse models, glycolysis inhibition by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in combination with MWA results in long-term anti-tumor effect via enhancing differentiation of tumor-specific CD44hiCD62L+CD8+ TCM cells. Enhancement of CD8+ TCM cell differentiation determined by Stat-1, is dependent on the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) but takes place in peripheral blood, with metabolic remodeling of CD8+ T cells lasting the entire course of the the combination therapy. Importantly, in-vitro glycolysis inhibition in peripheral CD8+ T cells of patients with breast or liver tumors having been treated with MWA thrice leads to their differentiation into CD8+ TCM cells. Our work thus offers a potential strategy to avoid tumor recurrence following MWA therapy and lays down the proof-of-principle for future clinical trials.",
Clonal hematopoiesis impacts frailty in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients: a retrospective multicenter analysis,"Elisa Gelli, Claudia Martinuzzi, Debora Soncini, Concetta Conticello, Francesco Ladisa, Giulia Giorgetti, Dario Truffelli, Isabella Traverso, Francesco Lai, Fabio Guolo, Maurizio Miglino, Antonia Cagnetta, Antonella Laudisi, Sara Aquino, Daniele Derudas, Francesco Di Raimondo, Domenico A. Coviello, Roberto M. Lemoli, Michele Cea",2024-11-26,"Somatic mutations of hematopoietic cells in the peripheral blood of normal individuals refer to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which is associated with a 0.5–1% risk of progression to hematological malignancies and cardiovascular diseases. CHIP has also been reported in Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients, but its biological relevance remains to be elucidated. In this study, high-depth targeted sequencing of peripheral blood from 76 NDMM patients revealed CHIP in 46% of them, with a variant allele frequency (VAF) ranging from ~ 1 to 34%. The most frequently mutated gene was DNMT3A, followed by TET2. More aggressive disease features were observed among CHIP carriers, who also exhibited higher proportion of high-risk stages (ISS and R-ISS 3) compared to controls. Longitudinal analyses at diagnosis and during follow-up showed a slight increase of VAFs (p = 0.058) for epigenetic (DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1) and DNA repair genes (TP53; p = 0.0123). A more stable frequency was observed among other genes, suggesting different temporal dynamics of CH clones. Adverse clinical outcomes, in term of overall and progression-free survivals, were observed in CHIP carriers. These patients also exhibited weakened immune T-cells and enhanced frailty, predicting greater toxicity and consequently shorter event-free survival. Finally, correlation analysis identified platelets count as biomarker for higher VAF among CHIP carriers, regardless of the specific variant. Overall, our study highlights specific biological and clinical features, paving the way for the development of tailored strategies for MM patients carrying CHIP.","Multiple myeloma, Biomarkers, CHIP, Toxicity, Frailty"
Circulating thrombospondin 2 as a predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B patients undergoing nucleos(t)ide analog therapy,"Taiki Okumura, Takefumi Kimura, Yuki Ichikawa, Takanobu Iwadare, Shun-ichi Wakabayashi, Hiroyuki Kobayashi, Yuki Yamashita, Takuro Uchida, Sai P. Pydi, Naoki Tanaka, Takeji Umemura",2024-10-26,"Thrombospondin 2 (TSP2) plays a vital role in collagen/fibrin formation, bone growth, vascular density regulation, hemostasis, and cell adhesion. Close associations of serum TSP2 with histological severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic hepatitis C were reported. The present study investigated the significance of circulating TSP2 in chronic hepatitis B patients. Eighty-seven biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis B patients were analyzed in cross-sectional Study 1 to search for correlations between serum TSP2 levels prior to liver biopsy and clinicopathological parameters. In longitudinal Study 2, 51 chronic hepatitis B patients with long-term follow-up (mean: 7.5 years) were examined for changes in serum TSP2 levels during nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy along with trends in hepatocarciongenesis. In Study 1, serum TSP2 levels were not significantly associated with portal inflammation or fibrosis. Study 2 revealed that serum TSP2 was significantly decreased after 48 weeks of NA therapy (P < 0.001). Notably, TSP2 levels at 48 weeks of NA administration (TSP2-48W) were significantly higher in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (+) group than in the HCC (−) group (P = 0.043). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that higher TSP2-48W (≥ 24 ng/mL) was associated with future HCC development (P = 0.030). Serum TSP2 levels may be a potential predictor of HCC development in hepatitis B patients receiving NA therapy. Longitudinal prospective studies are necessary to validate our findings.","Hepatitis B, Nucleos(t)ide analog, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Thrombospondin 2, Biomarker"
Radiation dermatitis in the hairless mouse model mimics human radiation dermatitis,"Jessica Lawrence, Davis Seelig, Kimberly Demos-Davies, Clara Ferreira, Yanan Ren, Li Wang, Sk. Kayum Alam, Rendong Yang, Alonso Guedes, Angela Craig, Luke H. Hoeppner",2024-10-22,"Over half of all people diagnosed with cancer receive radiation therapy. Moderate to severe radiation dermatitis occurs in most human radiation patients, causing pain, aesthetic distress, and a negative impact on tumor control. No effective prevention or treatment for radiation dermatitis exists. The lack of well-characterized, clinically relevant animal models of human radiation dermatitis contributes to the absence of strategies to mitigate radiation dermatitis. Here, we establish and characterize a hairless SKH-1 mouse model of human radiation dermatitis by correlating temporal stages of clinical and pathological skin injury. We demonstrate that a single ionizing radiation treatment of 30 Gy using 6 MeV electrons induces severe clinical grade 3 peak toxicity at 12 days, defined by marked erythema, desquamation and partial ulceration, with resolution occurring by 25 days. Histopathology reveals that radiation-induced skin injury features temporally unique inflammatory changes. Upregulation of epidermal and dermal TGF-ß1 and COX-2 protein expression occurs at peak dermatitis, with sustained epidermal TGF-ß1 expression beyond resolution. Specific histopathological variables that remain substantially high at peak toxicity and early clinical resolution, including epidermal thickening, hyperkeratosis and dermal fibroplasia/fibrosis, serve as specific measurable parameters for in vivo interventional preclinical studies that seek to mitigate radiation-induced skin injury.","Translational, Dermatitis, Radiation, Skin, Inflammation, TGF-ß1"
Articulation in postoperative patients treated for early- and advanced-stage tongue cancer,"Chun-Hsien Ho, Ching-Nung Wu, Chi-Chih Lai, Pei-Chun Huang, Hsin-Chen Li",2024-10-27,"Tongue cancer is among the most prevalent head and neck cancers and is most commonly treated via surgery. We assessed the articulation differences in patients with early and advanced tongue cancer. The study included 26 postoperative tongue cancer patients. We evaluated articulation based on bilabial, labiodental, apical, posterior, laminal, apical front, and apical back speech sounds. The 26 postoperative tongue cancer patients (24 males, two females) had an average age of 54.3 (range 37–89 old) years. Twelve patients were classified as early T stage (T1/T2), while 14 were classified as advanced T stage (T3/T4). The total articulation score was not significantly related to the T stage but apical sounds were so associated. The total articulation score did not significantly differ between postoperative patients with early and advanced tongue cancer. In subgroup analysis, the apical sound was significantly impaired in postoperative patients with advanced tongue cancer.","Articulation, Tongue cancer, Tumor stage, T stage"
