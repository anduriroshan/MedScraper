Transpulmonary chemoembolization and microwave ablation for recurrent or advanced non-small cell Lung Cancer,"Thomas J. Vogl, Kuei-An Chen, Hao Li, Mohamed E.M. Fouad, Zahra Afraz, Hamzah Adwan",2024-10-26,"To verify the treatment effect of the combination of transpulmonary chemoembolization (TPCE) and microwave ablation (MWA), targeting the treatment of recurrent or advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 53 patients were studied and grouped according to the diameter of the largest pulmonary nodule, defined as index tumor size (ITS). Patients with an ITS > 3 cm (n = 20) were treated with TPCE and MWA. Patients with an ITS ≤ 3 cm were treated either with a combination therapy (n = 24) or MWA alone (n = 9). The treatment response, including complications and survival outcome, was then analyzed. After TPCE, there was an average ITS reduction of 0.91 cm, and 25% of patients in ITS > 3 cm were downgraded to ITS ≤ 3 cm. After TPCE, there were 12 patients (27%) with PR status and 32 (73%) with SD status. No PD patient in our case series was noted before MWA.The complication rate of MWA was significantly higher in ITS ≤ 3 cm than in ITS > 3 cm (p = 0.013). The median survival time (MST) was 26.7 months, and the time to progression was 13.2 months. The patients in the ITS ≤ 3 cm had longer MST than the others (31.6 vs. 15.8 months, p = 0.003). The significant prognostic factor was ITS > 3 cm (HR: 1.18, p = 0.02). A combination of TPCE and MWA might be feasible to control non-operable, recurrent, or advanced NSCLC.","Transpulmonary chemoembolization, Microwave ablation, Non-small cell lung cancer, Interventional radiology"
Camrelizumab plus apatinib for previously treated advanced adrenocortical carcinoma: a single-arm phase 2 trial,"Yu-Chun Zhu, Zhi-Gong Wei, Jing-Jing Wang, Yi-Yan Pei, Jing Jin, Dong Li, Zhi-Hui Li, Zhe-Ran Liu, Yu Min, Rui-Dan Li, Li Yang, Ji-Yan Liu, Qiang Wei, Xing-Chen Peng",2024-11-29,"Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Therapeutic options for patients with advanced ACC who have failed standard treatments are limited. Single-agent immunotherapy as a second-line treatment has shown unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. This phase II trial (NCT04318730) evaluated the efficacy and safety of the PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab combined with the VEGFR inhibitor apatinib in previously treated advanced ACC. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 21 patients with advanced ACC received at least one dose of camrelizumab and apatinib. The ORR was 52% (95% CI, 30−74%), meeting the primary endpoint, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 95% (95% CI, 76−100%). The median PFS was 13.3 months (95% CI, 8.4−NE), and the median OS was 20.9 months (95% CI, 11.0−NE). The most common grade 3−4 treatment-related adverse events were alanine aminotransferase elevation, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, and lymphopenia. Predefined exploratory analyses indicated that patients with higher peripheral blood CXCR3 + CD8 + T cell abundance, lower immunosuppressive CD4 + T cell abundance, and higher overlap of clonotypes between tumor-infiltrating T cells and circulating T cells, were more likely to respond favorably to the combined therapy.",
Single-cell sequencing reveals immune features of treatment response to neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Zhenlin Yang, He Tian, Xiaowei Chen, Bozhao Li, Guangyu Bai, Qingyuan Cai, Jiachen Xu, Wei Guo, Shuaibo Wang, Yue Peng, Qing Liang, Liyan Xue, Shugeng Gao",2024-10-22,"Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (nICT) has dramatically changed the treatment landscape of operable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but factors influencing tumor response to nICT are not well understood. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing paired with T cell receptor sequencing, we profile tissues from ESCC patients accepting nICT treatment and characterize the tumor microenvironment context. CXCL13+CD8+ Tex cells, a subset of exhausted CD8+ T cells, are revealed to highly infiltrate in pre-treatment tumors and show prominent progenitor exhaustion phenotype in post-treatment samples from responders. We validate CXCL13+CD8+ Tex cells as a predictor of improved response to nICT and reveal CXCL13 to potentiate anti-PD-1 efficacy in vivo. Post-treatment tumors from non-responders are enriched for CXCL13+CD8+ Tex cells with notably remarkable exhaustion phenotype and TNFRSF4+CD4+ Tregs with activated immunosuppressive function and a significant clone expansion. Several critical markers for therapeutic resistance are also identified, including LRRC15+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ macrophages, which may recruit Tregs to form an immunosuppressive landscape. Overall, our findings unravel immune features of distinct therapeutic response to nICT treatment, providing a rationale for optimizing individualized neoadjuvant strategy in ESCC.",
Modified FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab versus bevacizumab in RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer: a randomized phase II DEEPER trial,"Manabu Shiozawa, Yu Sunakawa, Takanori Watanabe, Hirofumi Ota, Hisateru Yasui, Taichi Yabuno, Mitsuyoshi Tei, Mitsugu Kochi, Dai Manaka, Hisatsugu Ohori, Tatsuro Yamaguchi, Tamotsu Sagawa, Masahito Kotaka, Yutaro Kubota, Takashi Sekikawa, Masato Nakamura, Masahiro Takeuchi, Wataru Ichikawa, Masashi Fujii, Akihito Tsuji",2024-11-25,"The clinical significance of FOLFOXIRI (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) plus anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody using cetuximab for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains controversial. We report results from a randomized phase 2 DEEPER trial (UMIN000018217, jRCTs061180022) to test the superiority of modified (m)-FOLFOXIRI plus weekly cetuximab over bevacizumab in patients with RAS wild-type (wt) mCRC. Primary endpoint was depth of response (DpR). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), early tumor shrinkage (ETS) at week 8, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to tumor growth (TTG), time to treatment failure (TTF), association between tumor shrinkage and prognosis, association between TTG and prognosis, R0 resection rate, and safety. In 359 enrolled patients with RAS wt mCRC, median DpR was significantly better in cetuximab (57.3% vs 46.0%, p = 0.0029); however, ORR, ETS, R0 resection rate, TTG, TTF, PFS and OS were similar between 2 treatments. There was a weak association between DpR and survival time in both treatments. The correlation between TTG and OS was slightly stronger in cetuximab. The post-hoc exploratory analysis showed that cetuximab produced greater PFS (15.3 vs 11.7 months; HR 0.68) and OS (53.6 vs 40.2 months; HR 0.54) in patients with left-sided and RAS/BRAF wt tumors. m-FOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab has clinical benefit for tumor shrinkage in RAS wt mCRC. The survival benefit for RAS/BRAF wt and left-sided mCRC needs further investigation.",
Identification of HER2-positive breast cancer molecular subtypes with potential clinical implications in the ALTTO clinical trial,"Mattia Rediti, David Venet, Andrea Joaquin Garcia, Marion Maetens, Delphine Vincent, Samira Majjaj, Sarra El-Abed, Serena Di Cosimo, Takayuki Ueno, Miguel Izquierdo, Martine Piccart, Lajos Pusztai, Sherene Loi, Roberto Salgado, Giuseppe Viale, Françoise Rothé, Christos Sotiriou",2024-11-29,"In HER2-positive breast cancer, clinical outcome and sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies are influenced by both tumor and microenvironment features. However, we are currently unable to depict the molecular heterogeneity of this disease with sufficient granularity. Here, by performing gene expression profiling in HER2-positive breast cancers from patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab in the ALTTO clinical trial (NCT00490139), we identify and characterize five molecular subtypes associated with the risk of distant recurrence: immune-enriched, proliferative/metabolic-enriched, mesenchymal/stroma-enriched, luminal, and ERBB2-dependent. Additionally, we validate the biological profiles of the subtypes and explore their prognostic/predictive value in external cohorts, namely the NeoALTTO trial (NCT00553358), SCAN-B (NCT02306096), I-SPY2 (NCT01042379), METABRIC and TCGA. Immune-enriched tumors present better survival outcomes, in contrast to mesenchymal/stroma-enriched and proliferative/metabolic-enriched tumors, while luminal and ERBB2-dependent tumors are characterized by low and high rates of pathological complete response, respectively. Of note, these molecular subtypes provide the rationale for treatment approaches leveraging the heterogeneous biology of HER2-positive breast cancer.",
Alternating modified CAPOX/CAPIRI plus bevacizumab in untreated unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer: a phase 2 trial,"Sheng Li, Xiaoyou Li, Hanfeng Xu, Jiayuan Huang, Jingni Zhu, Ying Peng, Jun Bao, Liangjun Zhu",2024-12-11,"Previous studies showed encouraging efficacy of alternating FOLFOX/FOLFIRI for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This phase 2 trial (NCT04324476) aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of alternating modified CAPOX (capecitabine and oxaliplatin)/modified CAPIRI (capecitabine and irinotecan) plus bevacizumab (anti-VEGF-A antibody) in untreated unresectable mCRC. Induction treatment included capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid D2–8 and D16–22, oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 D1, irinotecan 150 mg/m2 D15, and bevacizumab 5 mg/kg D1 and 15 for 28-day cycles (up to six cycles). Capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid D2–15 and bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg D1 for 21-day cycles were used as maintenance treatment. 52 patients were included. Median follow-up was 25.0 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS; the primary endpoint) was 11.0 months (95% CI 9.0–12.4). Subgroup analyses showed patients with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio<5 or RAS wild-type disease had longer PFS (both P < 0.05). Objective response and disease control were obtained in 38 (73%; 95% CI 59%–84%) and 49 (94%; 95% CI 84%–99%), respectively. Mean depth of response, conversion and no evidence of disease rates were 46.0% ± 26.3%, 23% and 19%, respectively. Median overall survival was 28.1 months (18.4–34.0). Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) occurred in 17 (33%) patients. No treatment-related death was reported. The most common grade 3–4 TRAE were hypertension (13 [25%]), neutrophil count decreased (three [6%]), and hand-foot syndrome (two [4%]). In addition, grade 3–4 TRAE of diarrhea reported in one [2%] patient and no grade 3–4 peripheral neuropathy occurred. Thus, alternating modified CAPOX/CAPIRI plus bevacizumab had promising efficacy and acceptable safety. The regimen may be a novel option for untreated unresectable mCRC.",
Entinostat in combination with nivolumab in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a phase 2 clinical trial,"Marina Baretti, Ludmila Danilova, Jennifer N. Durham, Courtney B.

Gaykalova, Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian, Elana J. Fertig, Lisa M. Coussens, Mark Yarchoan, Elizabeth Jaffee, Nilofer S. Azad",2024-11-12,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by low cytotoxic lymphocytes, abundant immune-suppressive cells, and resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Preclinical PDA models showed the HDAC inhibitor entinostat reduced myeloid cell immunosuppression, sensitizing tumors to ICI therapy. This phase II study combined entinostat with nivolumab (PD1 inhibitor) in patients with advanced PDA (NCT03250273). Patients received entinostat 5 mg orally once weekly for 14-day lead-in, followed by entinostat and nivolumab. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included safety, duration of response, progression free-survival and overall survival. Between November 2017 and November 2020, 27 evaluable patients were enrolled. Three showed partial responses (11% ORR, 95% CI, 2.4%-29.2%) with a median response duration of 10.2 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were, respectively, 1.89 (95% CI, 1.381-2.301) and 2.729 (95% CI, 1.841-5.622) months. Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19 patients (63%), including decreased lymphocyte count, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hyponatremia. As exploratory analysis, peripheral and tumor immune profiles changes were assessed using CyTOF, mIHC, and RNA-seq. Entinostat increased dendritic cell activation and maturation. Gene expression analysis revealed an enrichment in inflammatory response pathways with combination treatment. Although the primary endpoint was not met, entinostat and nivolumab showed durable responses in a small subset of PDA patients. Myeloid cell immunomodulation supported the preclinical hypothesis, providing a basis for future combinatorial therapies to enhance clinical benefits in PDA.",
Perioperative Tislelizumab plus intensity modulated radiotherapy in resectable hepatocellular carcinoma with macrovascular invasion: a phase II trial,"Hongyu Pan, Liuyu Zhou, Zhuo Cheng, Jin Zhang, Ningjia Shen, Hongbin Ma, Yao Li, Riming Jin, Weiping Zhou, Dong Wu, Wen Sun, Ruoyu Wang",2024-10-29,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with macrovascular invasion (MVI) have dismal prognosis and there are no standard perioperative therapies. This phase 2 trial (ChiCTR2000036385) aimed to investigate the activity and safety of perioperative tislelizumab plus intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for resectable HCC with MVI. Thirty treatment-naïve patients with MVI received 3 cycles of tislelizumab intravenously (200 mg, every three weeks) and concurrent IMRT (45 Gray in 15 fractions). Primary endpoints were the overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients with a complete or major pathological response (pCR or MPR), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and safety. Of patients enrolled, 15 (50%) underwent curative surgery followed by adjuvant tislelizumab. The ORR was 30.0% (90% CI 16.6%-46.5%) and the median OS was 18.7 months. Of the 15 patients underwent surgical resection, 10 (66.7%) achieved pCR or MPR and 8 (53.3%) remained recurrence-free. The median RFS were not reached with a median follow-up of 21.77 months (95% CI 12.50-31.03) post-surgery. 4 (13.3%) patients experienced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events. The most common events were thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia. The trial has met the pre-specified endpoints, and these results support further studies of perioperative immunotherapy plus radiotherapy in HCC.",
Mitochondrial heteroplasmy improves risk prediction for myeloid neoplasms,"Yun Soo Hong, Sergiu Pasca, Wen Shi, Daniela Puiu, Nicole J. Lake, Monkol Lek, Meng Ru, Megan L. Grove, Anna Prizment, Corinne E. Joshu, Elizabeth A. Platz, Eliseo Guallar, Dan E. Arking, Lukasz P. Gondek",2024-11-22,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential is the primary pathogenic risk factor for myeloid neoplasms, while heteroplasmy (mutations in a subset of cellular mitochondrial DNA) is another marker of clonal expansion associated with hematological malignancies. We explore how these two markers relate and influence myeloid neoplasms incidence, and their role in risk stratification. We find that heteroplasmy is more common in individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, particularly those with higher variant allele fractions, multiple mutations, or spliceosome machinery mutations. Individuals with both markers have a higher risk of myeloid neoplasms than those with either alone. Furthermore, heteroplasmic variants with higher predicted deleteriousness increase the risk of myeloid neoplasms. Incorporating heteroplasmy in an existing risk score model for individuals with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential significantly improves sensitivity and better identifies high-risk groups. This suggests heteroplasmy as a clonal expansion marker and potentially as a biomarker for myeloid neoplasms development.",
Cullin-5 deficiency promotes chimeric antigen receptor T cell effector functions potentially via the modulation of JAK/STAT signaling pathway,"Yoshitaka Adachi, Seitaro Terakura, Masahide Osaki, Yusuke Okuno, Yoshitaka Sato, Ken Sagou, Yuki Takeuchi, Hirofumi Yokota, Kanae Imai, Peter Steinberger, Judith Leitner, Ryo Hanajiri, Makoto Murata, Hitoshi Kiyoi",2024-12-10,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell is a promising therapy for cancer, but factors that enhance the efficacy of CAR T cell remain elusive. Here we perform a genome-wide CRISPR screening to probe genes that regulate the proliferation and survival of CAR T cells following repetitive antigen stimulations. We find that genetic ablation of CUL5, encoding a core element of the multi-protein E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex, cullin-RING ligase 5, enhances human CD19 CAR T cell expansion potential and effector functions, potentially via the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. In this regard, CUL5 knockout CD19 CAR T cells show sustained STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation, as well as delayed phosphorylation and degradation of JAK1 and JAK3. In vivo, shRNA-mediated knockdown of CUL5 enhances CD19 CAR T treatment outcomes in tumor-bearing mice. Our findings thus imply that targeting CUL5 in the ubiquitin system may enhance CAR T cell effector functions to enhance immunotherapy efficacy.",
Acid-exposed and hypoxic cancer cells do not overlap but are interdependent for unsaturated fatty acid resources,"Katarzyna Głowacka, Sébastien Ibanez, Ophélie Renoult, Perrine Vermonden, Maria Virginia Giolito, Kübra Özkan, Charline Degavre, Léo Aubert, Céline Guilbaud, Florine Laloux-Morris, Elena Richiardone, Jérôme Ambroise, Caroline Bouzin, Davide Brusa, Jonas Dehairs, Johan Swinnen, Cyril Corbet, Yvan Larondelle, Olivier Feron",2024-11-21,"Cancer cells in acidic tumor regions are aggressive and a key therapeutic target, but distinguishing between acid-exposed and hypoxic cells is challenging. Here, we use carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) antibodies to mark acidic areas in both hypoxic and respiring tumor areas, along with an HRE-GFP reporter for hypoxia, to isolate distinct cell populations from 3D tumor spheroids. Transcriptomic analysis of CA9-positive, hypoxia-negative cells highlights enriched fatty acid desaturase activity. Inhibiting or silencing stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) induces ferroptosis in CA9-positive acidic cancer cells and delays mouse tumor growth, an effect enhanced by omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Using acid-exposed cancer cells and patient-derived tumor organoids, we show that SCD1 inhibition increases acidic cancer cell reliance on external mono-unsaturated fatty acids, depriving hypoxic cells of essential resources. This bystander effect provides unbiased evidence for a lack of full overlap between hypoxic and acidic tumor compartments, highlighting a rationale for targeting desaturase activity in cancer.",
CBFA2T3-GLIS2 mediates transcriptional regulation of developmental pathways through a gene regulatory network,"Elizabeth A. R. Garfinkle, Pratima Nallagatla, Binay Sahoo, Jinjun Dang, Mohammad Balood, Anitria Cotton, Camryn Franke, Sharnise Mitchell, Taylor Wilson, Tanja A. Gruber",2024-10-09,"CBFA2T3-GLIS2 is a fusion oncogene found in pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia that is associated with a poor prognosis. We establish a model of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 driven acute megakaryoblastic leukemia that allows the distinction of fusion specific changes from those that reflect the megakaryoblast lineage of this leukemia. Using this model, we map fusion genome wide binding that in turn imparts the characteristic transcriptional signature. A network of transcription factor genes bound and upregulated by the fusion are found to have downstream effects that result in dysregulated signaling of developmental pathways including NOTCH, Hedgehog, TGFβ, and WNT. Transcriptional regulation is mediated by homo-dimerization and binding of the ETO transcription factor through the nervy homology region 2. Loss of nerve homology region 2 abrogated the development of leukemia, leading to downregulation of JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, and NOTCH transcriptional signatures. These data contribute to the understanding of CBFA2T3-GLIS2 mediated leukemogenesis and identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities for future studies.",
The IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab in previously treated lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes: a phase 2 clinical trial,"Juan Jose Rodriguez-Sevilla, Vera Adema, Kelly S. Chien, Sanam Loghavi, Feiyang Ma, Hui Yang, Guillermo Montalban-Bravo, Xuelin Huang, Xavier Calvo, Joby Joseph, Kristy Bodden, Guillermo Garcia-Manero, Simona Colla",2024-11-13,"In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), the IL-1β pathway is upregulated, and previous studies using mouse models of founder MDS mutations demonstrated that it enhances hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells’ (HSPCs’) aberrant differentiation towards the myeloid lineage at the expense of erythropoiesis. To evaluate whether targeting the IL-1β signaling pathway can rescue ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with MDS, we designed a phase 2 non-randomized single-arm clinical trial (NCT04239157) to assess the safety profile and efficacy of the IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients. We enrolled 25 patients with a median age of 74 years; 60% were male, 16% had lower-risk MDS, 84% had intermediate-1 risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System score, and 80% failed hypomethylating agent therapy. The study met the primary endpoint of defining the clinical activity of canakinumab, and the secondary objective of determining the safety profile, including the rate of transfusion independence, the duration of response, progression-free survival, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival. The overall response rate was 17.4%, with all responses including hematological improvement. Sequential post-hoc prospective single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of HSPCs and bone marrow mononuclear cells at different time points during therapy showed that canakinumab’s on-target effects in hematopoietic populations expressing the IL-1β receptor decreased the TNF-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway but rescued ineffective erythropoiesis only in the context of lower genetic complexity. This study demonstrates that better stratification strategies could target lower-risk MDS patients more effectively.",

We comprehensively describe the genomic and transcriptomic landscape of a cohort of 117 GISTs including 31 low-risk, 18 intermediate-risk, 29 high-risk, 34 metastatic and 5 neoadjuvant GISTs from 105 patients. GISTs have notably low tumor mutation burden but widespread copy number variations. Aggressive GISTs harbor remarkably more genomic aberrations than low-/intermediate-risk GISTs. Complex genomic alterations, chromothripsis and kataegis, occur selectively in aggressive GISTs. Despite the paucity of mutations, recurrent inactivating YLPM1 mutations are identified (10.3%, 7 of 68 patients), enriched in high-risk/metastatic GIST and functional study further demonstrates YLPM1 inactivation promotes GIST proliferation, growth and oxidative phosphorylation. Spatially and temporally separated GISTs from individual patients demonstrate complex tumor heterogeneity in metastatic GISTs. Finally, four prominent subtypes are proposed with different genomic features, expression profiles, immune characteristics, clinical characteristics and subtype-specific treatment strategies. This large-scale analysis depicts the landscape and provides further insights into GIST pathogenesis and precise treatment.",
AR alterations inform circulating tumor DNA detection in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients,"Todd P. Knutson, Bin Luo, Anna Kobilka, Jacqueline Lyman, Siyuan Guo, Sarah A.

In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), ctDNA assays are needed to prognosticate outcomes of patients treated with androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors. We develop a custom targeted cfDNA sequencing assay, named AR-ctDETECT, to detect ctDNA in limiting plasma cfDNA available from mCRPC patients in the Alliance A031201 randomized phase 3 trial of enzalutamide with or without abiraterone. Of 776 patients, 59% are ctDNA-positive, with 26% having high ctDNA aneuploidy and 33% having low ctDNA aneuploidy but displaying AR gain or structural rearrangement, MYC/MYCN gain, or a pathogenic mutation. ctDNA-positive patients have significantly worse median overall survival than ctDNA-negative patients (29.0 months vs. 47.4 months, respectively). Here, we show that mCRPC patients identified as ctDNA-positive using the AR-ctDETECT assay have poor survival despite treatment with potent AR inhibitors in a phase 3 trial.",
Surgery alone versus neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery in patients with stage T2N0M0 esophageal cancer,"Yan Lin, Shou-Feng Wang, Huan-Wei Liang, Yang Liu, Wei Huang, Xin-Bin Pan",2024-11-21,"To compare the survival outcomes of patients with stage T2N0M0 esophageal cancer treated with surgery alone versus those treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Patients with stage T2N0M0 esophageal cancer, who either underwent surgery alone or received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database covering the period from 2000 to 2020. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) between the two treatment groups were compared. A total of 583 patients were included: 267 (45.8%) received surgery alone, while 316 (54.2%) underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Prior to propensity score matching, no significant differences were observed between the surgery alone and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy groups in terms of 5-year CSS (60.86% vs. 59.02%; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–1.29; P = 0.916) and OS (50.64% vs. 49.81%; HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.75–1.12; P = 0.375). After propensity score matching, the 5-year CSS (66.43% vs. 56.67%; HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.89–1.64; P = 0.225) and OS (56.49% vs. 47.37%; HR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.85–1.40; P = 0.481) remained statistically similar between the two groups. Subgroup analyses of patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma revealed no significant differences in survival outcomes between the treatment modalities for either histological subtype. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery does not confer a survival advantage over surgery alone in patients with stage T2N0M0 esophageal cancer, irrespective of histological subtype.","Esophageal cancer, Stage T2N0M0, Surgery, Chemoradiotherapy, Survival outcomes"

This study dissects the intra-tumoral diversity of CAFs in basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma using molecular and spatial single-cell analysis. We identify three distinct CAF subtypes: myofibroblast-like RGS5+ CAFs, matrix CAFs (mCAFs), and immunomodulatory CAFs (iCAFs). Large-cohort tissue analysis reveals significant shifts in CAF subtype patterns with increasing malignancy. Two CAF subtypes exhibit immunomodulatory properties via different mechanisms. mCAFs sythesize extracellular matrix and may restrict T cell invasion in low-grade tumors via ensheathing tumor nests, while iCAFs are enriched in late-stage tumors, and express high levels of cytokines and chemokines to aid immune cell recruitment and activation. This is supported by the induction of an iCAF-like phenotype with immunomodulatory functions in primary healthy fibroblasts exposed to skin cancer cell secretomes. Thus, targeting CAF variants holds promise to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in skin cancers.",
PU.1 eviction at lymphocyte-specific chromatin domains mediates glucocorticoid response in acute lymphoblastic leukemia,"Dominik Beck, Honghui Cao, Feng Tian, Yizhou Huang, Miao Jiang, Han Zhao, Xiaolu Tai, Wenqian Xu, Hansen J.

Lock, Charles E. de Bock, Duohui Jing",2024-11-08,"The epigenetic landscape plays a critical role in cancer progression, yet its therapeutic potential remains underexplored. Glucocorticoids are essential components of treatments for lymphoid cancers, but resistance, driven in part by epigenetic changes at glucocorticoid-response elements, poses a major challenge to effective therapies. Here we show that glucocorticoid treatment induces distinct patterns of chromosomal organization in glucocorticoid-sensitive and resistant acute lymphoblastic leukemia xenograft models. These glucocorticoid-response elements are primed by the pioneer transcription factor PU.1, which interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor. Eviction of PU.1 promotes receptor binding, increasing the expression of genes involved in apoptosis and facilitating a stronger therapeutic response. Treatment with a PU.1 inhibitor enhances glucocorticoid sensitivity, demonstrating the clinical potential of targeting this pathway. This study uncovers a mechanism involving PU.1 and the glucocorticoid receptor, linking transcription factor activity with drug response, and suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for overcoming resistance.",
Sentinel lymph node mapping with Indocyanine green fluorescence (ICG) for pediatric and adolescent tumors: a prospective observational study,"Luca Pio, Celine Richard, Tarek Zaghloul, Andrew J.

Precise visual localization of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) during the operation is a key challenge of this procedure. Presently, the gold standard method employing Technetium 99 (99mTc) for localization carries a notable false-negative rate. In this context, we propose evaluating the use of Indocyanine Green near-infrared (ICG-NIR) as a supplementary tool to enhance the identification of SLN. A prospective observational study focused on pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing SLNB using ICG-NIR at a single institution from 2019 to 2022. Lymphoscintigraphy with 99mTc was performed before surgery and 99mTc was detected intraoperatively using a handheld gamma probe. ICG was administered intraoperatively and assessed using transcutaneous NIR. The study collected demographic data, intra-operative findings (Technetium 99 m, ICG fluorescence), and histopathological data. Eight patients with a median age of 16 years (range: 8–19 years) underwent fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node harvesting with 100% sensitivity. Sentinel lymph node fluorescence was verified with a positive radiosignal in all patients. No adverse events were recorded. Fluorescence-guided assessment of the lymphatic system is both feasible and effective for sentinel lymph node identification. Nevertheless, larger-scale studies are essential to establish indocyanine green as a viable alternative rather than a complementary technique alongside the gold-standard radioisotope-guided method for sentinel lymph node assessment in children.","Sentinel lymph node, Indocyanine green Technetium‐99, Pediatric tumors"
Nivolumab plus anlotinib hydrochloride in advanced gastric adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: the phase II OASIS trial,"Jing Wu, Shilong Zhang, Shan Yu, Guo An, Yi Wang, Yiyi Yu, Li Liang, Yan Wang, Xiaojing Xu, YanShi Xiong, Di Shao, Zhun Shi, Nannan Li, Jingyuan Wang, Dawei Jin, Tianshu Liu, Yuehong Cui",2024-10-15,"Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), possess immunomodulatory properties and have shown promising outcomes when combined with anti-PD-1 antibodies. The OASIS phase II trial (NCT04503967) is designed to determine the clinical activity and safety of nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and anlotinib hydrochloride (a multi-targets TKI) as second-line or above therapy in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). From December 2020 to September 2022, 45 patients with GAC and 3 with ESCC were enrolled in this study. The pre-specified endpoints were reached, with the primary endpoint of overall response rate achieving 29.2%. For secondary objectives, disease control rate was 64.6%; median progression-free survival was 4.0 months; and median overall survival was 11.1 months with a manageable toxicity profile. The exploratory analyses unveiled that the balance of gut bacteria and the presence of a pre-existing immune signature characterized by a high percentage of CD68+PD-L1+ PD-1+ macrophages and low pretreatment variant allele frequencies (VAF), as well as low expression of certain cytokines were significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes in patients with GAC.",

Mahoney",2024-11-15,"Oncolytic viruses (OV) are designed to selectively infect and kill cancer cells, while simultaneously eliciting antitumour immunity. The mechanism is expected to originate from infected cancer cells. However, recent reports of tumour regression unaccompanied by cancer cell infection suggest a more complex mechanism of action. Here, we engineered vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)ΔM51-sensitive and VSVΔM51-resistant tumour lines to elucidate the role of OV-infected cancer and non-cancer cells. We found that, while cancer cell infections elicit oncolysis and antitumour immunity as expected, infection of non-cancer cells alone can also contribute to tumour regression. This effect is partly attributed to the systemic production of cytokines that promote dendritic cell (DC) activation, migration and antigen cross-presentation, leading to magnified antitumour CD8+ T cell activation and tumour regression. Such OV-induced antitumour immunity is complementary to PD-1 blockade. Overall, our results reveal mechanistic insights into OV-induced antitumour immunity that can be leveraged to improve OV-based therapeutics.",

B-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors emerging from B-cells at different stages of differentiation and exhibiting tumor-specific interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the effect of drug treatments can be influenced by the tumor composition and functional interactions among immune cells. Here, we develop a platform to maintain small fragments of human lymphoma tissue in culture for several days, and use them to test response to small molecules. We collect 27 patient samples representative of different lymphoma subtypes, and establish ex vivo tissue fragments that retain histological, cellular, and molecular characteristics of the original tissue, here referred to as lymphomoids. Using lymphomoids, we test sensitivity to several clinically approved drugs in parallel and examine tissue remodeling upon treatment. Moreover, when this information is available, we show that the effect of the inhibitors observed in lymphomoids is consistent with the patients’ response in the clinic. Thus, lymphomoids represent an innovative ex vivo model to assess the effect of anti-cancer therapies while preserving the tissue structure and its components.",
Concurrent intratumoural Treg cell depletion and CD8+ T cell expansion via a cleavable anti-4-1BB–interleukin-15 fusion protein,"Yueqi Cai, Zilong Han, Jiao Shen, Zhuangzhi Zou, Jingya Guo, Yong Liang, Shijie Li, Huiping Liao, Zhenhua Ren, Hua Peng, Yang-Xin Fu",2024-12-02,"Potent agonists of the inducible co-stimulatory receptor 4-1BB are too toxic for patients with advanced cancer. Here, on the basis of observations of a weak agonist of 4-1BB depleting regulatory T (Treg) cells within the tumour microenvironment without leading to substantial restoration of dysfunctional cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), we show that effective tumour control can be achieved via concurrent Treg cell depletion and CTL expansion through an anti-4-1BB antibody fused to interleukin-15 (IL-15) via a peptide sensitive to tumour proteases. In mouse models of advanced cancers, intraperitoneal injection of the bifunctional protein attenuated the activity of the interleukin mostly in the periphery of the primary tumour while allowing for the expansion of CTLs within the tumour microenvironment, led to more effective tumour inhibition and to lower systemic toxicity than treating the cancers with combinatorial treatment with unlinked anti-4-1BB antibody and IL-15, and reduced the resistance of tumours to checkpoint blockade. Concurrent eradication of Treg cells and activation of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes may represent a general strategy for the effective control of advanced metastatic tumours.",

A total of 532 patients with confirmed PCa diagnosis through biopsy were enrolled from six medical centers in Sudan. The majority of patients, comprising 84.2% (448/532), were diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, with a Grade group above 3. There were no discernible differences in PCa aggressiveness among the ethnolinguistic groups. However, higher levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were observed in the Niger-Congo group, where 55.2% had PSA values exceeding 50 ng/ml. Patients from this group were also diagnosed at a younger age. In contrast, 90.5% of Afro-Asiatic patients are over 60 years old. Further analysis conducted within an age-matched subgroup of patients (n = 273) revealed a higher incidence of perineural invasion in the Afro-Asiatic group. This research represents the first investigation of PCa across different African ethnic groups and associates a higher incidence of perineural invasion with a specific ethnic group. While recent efforts have been made to establish African-relevant risk models to mitigate PCa health disparities, there remains a need for further investigation into genetically distinct populations within the African continent.","Perineural invasion, Prostate cancer, Sudan, Niger-Congo, Nilo-Saharan, Afro-Asiatic, Incidence"

A bioinspired sulfur–Fe–heme nanozyme with selective peroxidase-like activity for enhanced tumor chemotherapy,"Shuaibing Zhang, Xuejiao J. Gao, Yuanjie Ma, Kexu Song, Mengyue Ge, Saiyu Ma, Lirong Zhang, Ye Yuan, Wei Jiang, Zhenzhen Wu, Lizeng Gao, Xiyun Yan, Bing Jiang",2024-12-05,"Iron-based nanozymes, recognized for their biocompatibility and peroxidase-like activities, hold promise as catalysts in tumor therapy. However, their concurrent catalase-like activity undermines therapeutic efficacy by converting hydrogen peroxide in tumor tissues into oxygen, thus diminishing hydroxyl radical production. Addressing this challenge, this study introduces the hemin–cysteine–Fe (HCFe) nanozyme, which exhibits exclusive peroxidase-like activity. Constructed through a supramolecular assembly approach involving Fmoc-l-cysteine, heme, and Fe²⁺ coordination, HCFe distinctly incorporates heme and [Fe–S] within its active center. Sulfur coordination to the central Fe atom of Hemin is crucial in modulating the catalytic preference of the HCFe nanozyme towards peroxidase-like activity. This unique mechanism distinguishes HCFe from other bifunctional iron-based nanozymes, enhancing its catalytic selectivity even beyond that of natural peroxidases. This selective activity allows HCFe to significantly elevate ROS production and exert cytotoxic effects, especially against cisplatin-resistant esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells and their xenografts in female mice when combined with cisplatin. These findings underscore HCFe’s potential as a crucial component in multimodal cancer therapy, notably in augmenting chemotherapy efficacy.",
T cell dynamics with neoadjuvant immunotherapy in head and neck cancer,"Maryann Zhao, Jonathan D. Schoenfeld, Ann Marie Egloff, Glenn J. Hanna, Robert I. Haddad, Douglas R. Adkins, Ravindra Uppaluri",2024-12-10,"Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being tested as neoadjuvant therapies in various solid tumours, including in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with promising results. Key findings thus far include that this approach is well-tolerated with favourable clinical outcomes including promising pathological response rates in initial studies. Pathological responses are likely to be increased by combining other agents with anti-PD-(L)1 antibodies. Comparisons of baseline biopsy samples with post-treatment surgical specimens have enabled correlative studies utilizing multiomic and immunogenomic methods. Data from these studies suggest that pretreatment intratumoural tissue-resident memory CD8+ T cells are key drivers of tumour regression and give rise to both local and systemic antitumour immune responses. Analyses of systemic responses have defined a PD-1+KLRG1− circulating CD8+ T cell subpopulation that is highly predictive of response, and revealed the interrelationships between intratumoural clones and circulating CD8+ T cells. Lastly, interrogation of T cell populations within lymph nodes is beginning to delineate the immune crosstalk between the primary tumour and tumour-draining lymph nodes and how this relationship might be disrupted with tumour infiltration of the latter. In this Review, we examine data from trials testing neoadjuvant ICIs in patients with HNSCC, focusing on human papillomavirus-unrelated disease, and highlight correlative immunogenomic findings from these trials.",

Here, we present an in-depth characterization of the bone marrow immune ecosystem of multiple myeloma long-term survivors, from initial diagnosis up to 17 years following a single therapy line and cancer-free survival. Using comparative single-cell analyses combined with molecular, genomic, and functional approaches, we demonstrate that multiple myeloma long-term survivors exhibit pronounced alterations in their bone marrow microenvironment associated with impaired immunity. These immunological alterations were frequently linked to an inflammatory immune circuit fueled by the long-term persistence or resurgence of residual myeloma cells. Notably, even in the complete absence of any detectable residual disease for decades, sustained changes in the immune system were observed, suggesting an irreversible ‘immunological scarring’ caused by the initial exposure to the cancer and therapy. Collectively, our study provides key insights into the molecular and cellular bone marrow ecosystem of long-term survivors of multiple myeloma, revealing both reversible and irreversible alterations in the immune compartment.",

The clinical burden of LMD has been increasing secondary to more sensitive diagnostics, aggressive local therapies for discrete brain metastases, and improved management of extracranial disease with targeted and immunotherapeutic agents, resulting in improved survival. However, owing to drug delivery challenges and the unique microenvironment of LMD, novel therapies against systemic disease have not yet translated into improved outcomes for these patients. Underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are common, response assessment remains challenging, and the prognosis associated with this disease of whole neuroaxis remains extremely poor. The dearth of effective therapies is further challenged by the difficulties in studying this dynamic disease state. In this Review, a multidisciplinary group of experts describe the emerging evidence and areas of active investigation in LMD and provide directed recommendations for future research. Drawing upon paradigm-changing advances in mechanistic science, computational approaches, and trial design, the authors discuss domain-specific and cross-disciplinary strategies for optimizing the clinical and translational research landscape for LMD. Advances in diagnostics, multi-agent intrathecal therapies, cell-based therapies, immunotherapies, proton craniospinal irradiation and ongoing clinical trials offer hope for improving outcomes for patients with LMD.",
Human single cell RNA-sequencing reveals a targetable CD8+ exhausted T cell population that maintains mouse low-grade glioma growth,"Rasha Barakat, Jit Chatterjee, Rui Mu, Xuanhe Qi, Xingxing Gu, Igor Smirnov, Olivia Cobb, Karen Gao, Angelica Barnes, Jonathan Kipnis, David H. Gutmann",2024-11-28,"In solid cancers, T cells typically function as cytotoxic effectors to limit tumor growth, prompting therapies that capitalize upon this antineoplastic property (immune checkpoint inhibition; ICI). Unfortunately, ICI treatments have been largely ineffective for high-grade brain tumors (gliomas; HGGs). Leveraging several single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we report greater CD8+ exhausted T cells in human pediatric low-grade gliomas (LGGs) relative to adult and pediatric HGGs. Using several preclinical mouse LGG models (Nf1-OPG mice), we show that these PD1+/TIGIT+ CD8+ exhausted T cells are restricted to the tumor tissue, where they express paracrine factors necessary for OPG growth. Importantly, ICI treatments with α-PD1 and α-TIGIT antibodies attenuate Nf1-OPG tumor proliferation through suppression of two cytokine (Ccl4 and TGFβ)-mediated mechanisms, rather than by T cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as well as suppress monocyte-controlled T cell chemotaxis.

Sobota, Choon Seng Chong, Ker-Kan Tan, Yongliang Zhang",2024-11-21,"Notch1 plays various roles in cancer development, and Notch1-induced transactivation is controlled by phosphorylation of its cleaved intracellular domain. However, it is unclear whether there are phosphatases capable of dephosphorylating the cleaved Notch1 transmembrane/intracellular region (NTM) to regulate its function. Here, we show that DUSP6 can function as a phosphatase for Notch1, thereby regulating NTM stability and transcriptional activity, thus influencing colorectal cancer (CRC) development. In human CRC cells, elevated DUSP6 expression correlates with increased NTM levels, leading to enhanced CRC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. High tumoral DUSP6 protein expression is associated with poorer overall CRC patient survival. In mice, DUSP6 deficiency results in reduced CRC development. Mechanistically, DUSP6 dephosphorylates phospho-Y2116, which in turn reduces NTM ubiquitination, leading to increased NTM stability and transcriptional activity. As a result, the expression of Notch1-targeted proliferation genes is increased to promote tumour cell growth.",

Galapate, Anagha Deshpande, Aniruddha J. Deshpande, David A. Scott, David W. Dawson, Cosimo Commisso",2024-12-03,"Macropinocytosis has emerged as a scavenging pathway that cancer cells exploit to survive in a nutrient-deprived microenvironment. Tumor cells are especially reliant on glutamine for their survival, and in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, glutamine deficiency can enhance the stimulation of macropinocytosis. Here, we identify the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) enzymes, PKCζ and PKCι, as regulators of macropinocytosis. In normal epithelial cells, aPKCs associate with the scaffold proteins Par3 and Par6 to regulate cell polarity, affecting several targets, including the Par1 kinases and we find that each of these proteins is required for macropinocytosis. Mechanistically, aPKCs are regulated by EGFR signaling or by the transcription factor CREM to promote the Par3 relocation to microtubules, facilitating macropinocytosis in a dynein-dependent manner. Importantly, cell fitness impairment caused by aPKC depletion is rescued by the restoration of macropinocytosis and aPKCs support PDAC growth in vivo. Our findings enhance our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings that control macropinocytic uptake in the context of metabolic stress.",

We detect neoTCRs with specificity for the previously detected neoantigens and perform fine-characterization of neoTCR-transgenic (tg) T cells in vitro and in vivo. We describe a heterogeneous spectrum of TCR-intrinsic activation patterns in response to a shared neoepitope ranging from previously detected more highly frequent neoTCRs with moderate activation to rare ones with initially stronger activation. Experimental restimulation of adoptively transferred neoTCR-tg T cells in a xenogeneic rechallenge tumor model demonstrates superior anti-tumor responses of moderate neoTCR-tg T cells upon repeated tumor contact.

Dual rectification of metabolism abnormality in pancreatic cancer by a programmed nanomedicine,"Bowen Wu, Zhiqin Wang, Jingyuan Liu, Naishi Li, Xudong Wang, HaoChen Bai, Chunling Wang, Jian Shi, Saiyang Zhang, Jian Song, Yiye Li, Guangjun Nie",2024-12-03,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy characterized by dysregulated energy and stromal metabolism. It is strongly supported by activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) which drive excessive desmoplasia and tumor growth via metabolic crosstalk. Herein, a programmed nanosystem is designed to dual rectify the metabolism abnormalities of the PDAC cells, which overexpress glucose transporter 1(GLUT1) and CD71, and the PSC for oncotherapy. The nanosystem is based on a tumor microenvironment-responsive liposome encapsulating an NF-κB inhibitor (TPCA-1) and a CD71 aptamer-linked Glut1 siRNA. TPCA-1 reverses the activated PSC to quiescence, which hampers metabolic support of the PSC to PDAC cells and bolsters the PDAC cell-targeting delivery of the siRNA. Aerobic glycolysis and the following enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation are restrained by the nano-modulation so as to amplify anti-PDAC efficacy in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, which implies more personalized PDAC treatment based on different energy metabolic profiles.",
Comparative analysis of the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic and open approaches for right anterior sectionectomy,"Wen Li, Haitao Zeng, Yong Huang",2024-12-04,"Laparoscopic hepatectomy has minimally invasive advantages, but reports on laparoscopic right anterior sectionectomy (LRAS) are rare.

The patients’ characteristics, intraoperative details, and postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups. No significant differences in the preoperative data were observed between the two groups. The LRAS group had significantly lesser blood loss (P = 0.019), a shorter hospital stay (P = 0.045), and a higher rate of bile leak (P = 0.039) than the ORAS group. There was no significant difference in the operative time (P = 0.156), transfusion rate (P = 0.385), hospital expenses (P = 0.511), rate of other complications, postoperative white blood cell count, and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels between the two groups (P > 0.05).

HER2-related biomarkers predict clinical outcomes with trastuzumab deruxtecan treatment in patients with HER2-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer: biomarker analyses of DESTINY-CRC01,"Salvatore Siena, Kanwal Raghav, Toshiki Masuishi, Kensei Yamaguchi, Tomohiro Nishina, Elena Elez, Javier Rodriguez, Ian Chau, Maria Di Bartolomeo, Hisato Kawakami, Fumitaka Suto, Makito Koga, Koichiro Inaki, Yusuke Kuwahara, Issey Takehara, Daniel Barrios, Kojiro Kobayashi, Axel Grothey, Takayuki Yoshino",2024-11-25,"DESTINY-CRC01 (NCT03384940) was a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study that investigated the safety and efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). The present exploratory biomarker analysis aims to investigate relationships between biomarkers and clinical outcomes in patients with HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+ and in situ hybridization [ISH] positive) Cohort A (N = 53) of DESTINY-CRC01. Higher levels of HER2 biomarkers in baseline tissue and liquid biopsies, including HER2 status (IHC/ISH), HER2/CEP17 ratio, HER2 ISH signals, HER2 H-score, plasma HER2 (ERBB2) amplification status, HER2 adjusted plasma copy number, and HER2 extracellular domain correlate with antitumor activity (indicated by objective response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival) of T-DXd. Baseline circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis suggests antitumor activity of T-DXd in patients who had baseline activating RAS, PIK3CA, or HER2 mutations detected in ctDNA.",
Early evolutionary branching across spatial domains predisposes to clonal replacement under chemotherapy in neuroblastoma,"Jenny Karlsson, Hiroaki Yasui, Adriana Mañas, Natalie Andersson, Karin Hansson, Kristina Aaltonen, Caroline Jansson, Geoffroy Durand, Naveen Ravi, Michele Ferro, Minjun Yang, Subhayan Chattopadhyay, Kajsa Paulsson, Diana Spierings, Floris Foijer, Anders Valind, Daniel Bexell, David Gisselsson",2024-10-18,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most lethal childhood cancers due to its propensity to become treatment resistant. By spatial mapping of subclone geographies before and after chemotherapy across 89 tumor regions from 12 NBs, we find that densely packed territories of closely related subclones present at diagnosis are replaced under effective treatment by islands of distantly related survivor subclones, originating from a different most recent ancestor compared to lineages dominating before treatment. Conversely, in tumors that progressed under treatment, ancestors of subclones dominating later in disease are present already at diagnosis. Chemotherapy treated xenografts and cell culture models replicate these two contrasting scenarios and show branching evolution to be a constant feature of proliferating NB cells. Phylogenies based on whole genome sequencing of 505 individual NB cells indicate that a rich repertoire of parallel subclones emerges already with the first oncogenic mutations and lays the foundation for clonal replacement under treatment.",
Generalizable and automated classification of TNM stage from pathology reports with external validation,"Jenna Kefeli, Jacob Berkowitz, Jose M. Acitores Cortina, Kevin K. Tsang, Nicholas P. Tatonetti",2024-10-16,"Cancer staging is an essential clinical attribute informing patient prognosis and clinical trial eligibility. However, it is not routinely recorded in structured electronic health records. Here, we present BB-TEN: Big Bird – TNM staging Extracted from Notes, a generalizable method for the automated classification of TNM stage directly from pathology report text. We train a BERT-based model using publicly available pathology reports across approximately 7000 patients and 23 cancer types. We explore the use of different model types, with differing input sizes, parameters, and model architectures. Our final model goes beyond term-extraction, inferring TNM stage from context when it is not included in the report text explicitly. As external validation, we test our model on almost 8000 pathology reports from Columbia University Medical Center, finding that our trained model achieved an AU-ROC of 0.815–0.942. This suggests that our model can be applied broadly to other institutions without additional institution-specific fine-tuning.",

We identified 215 lesions treated over 48 SRS courses in 34 patients. Median follow up from T-DXd initiation was 13.9 months. The cumulative incidence of symptomatic radiation necrosis at 24 months per lesion was 2.1% and per patient 11%. The 12-month LC was 97%. HER2-low was associated with worse distant intracranial control (DIC) (adjusted HR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1–5.6, p = 0.03) and worse systemic progression free survival (PFS) (HR 4.1, 95% CI 1.6–10.7, p = 0.004).

Burk, Bin Zhu, Lisa Mirabello",2024-09-12,"Invasive cervical cancers (ICC), caused by HPV infections, have a heterogeneous molecular landscape. We investigate the detection, timing, and HPV type specificity of somatic mutations in 3929 HPV-positive exfoliated cervical cell samples from individuals undergoing cervical screening in the U.S. using deep targeted sequencing in ICC cases, precancers, and HPV-positive controls. We discover a subset of hotspot mutations rare in controls (2.6%) but significantly more prevalent in precancers, particularly glandular precancer lesions (10.2%), and cancers (25.7%), supporting their involvement in ICC carcinogenesis. Hotspot mutations differ by HPV type, and HPV18/45-positive ICC are more likely to have multiple hotspot mutations compared to HPV16-positive ICC. The proportion of cells containing hotspot mutations is higher (i.e., higher variant allele fraction) in ICC and mutations are detectable up to 6 years prior to cancer diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using exfoliated cervical cells for detection of somatic mutations as potential diagnostic biomarkers.",
A dendritic cell vaccine for both vaccination and neoantigen-reactive T cell preparation for cancer immunotherapy in mice,"Qing Li, Hao Zeng, Ting Liu, Peipei Wang, Rui Zhang, Binyan Zhao, Tang Feng, Yuling Yang, Jiumei Wu, Yue Zheng, Bailing Zhou, Yang Shu, Heng Xu, Li Yang, Zhenyu Ding",2024-11-29,"Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) using neoantigen-specific T cells is an effective immunotherapeutic strategy. However, the difficult isolation of neoantigen-specific T cells limits the clinical application of ACT. Here, we propose a method to prepare neoantigen-reactive T cells (NRT) for ACT following immunization with a tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccine. We show that the DC vaccine not only induces a neoantigen-reactive immune response in lung cancer-bearing mice in vivo, but also facilitate NRT cell preparation in vitro. Adoptive transfer of the NRTs as combinatorial therapy into DC vaccine-immunized, LL/2 tumor-bearing mice allows infiltration of the infused NRTs, as well as the enrichment of neoantigen reactive, non-ACT/NRT T cells into the tumor microenvironment with the function of these neoantigen-reactive T-cell receptors validated in vitro. In summary, we propose a method for preparing NRTs that increases ACT efficacy and paves the way to the design of personalized immunotherapies.",

Our two-arm pilot study (NCT04895592) allocated 26 patients with BrM to either low (Arm A) or high (Arm B) dose peri-operative dexamethasone followed by pre-operative stereotactic radiosurgery (pSRS) and resection (n= 13 per arm). The primary endpoint, a safety analysis at 4 months, was met. The secondary clinical endpoints of overall survival, distant brain failure, leptomeningeal disease and local recurrence at 12-months were 66%, 37.3%, 6%, and 0% respectively and were not significantly different between arms (p= 0.7739, p= 0.3884, p= 0.3469). Immunological data from two large retrospective BrM datasets and confirmed by correlates from both arms of this pSRS prospective trial revealed that BrM CD8 T cells were composed of predominantly PD1+ TCF1+ stem-like and PD1+ TCF1-TIM3+ effector-like cells. Clustering of TCF1+ CD8 T cells with antigen presenting cells in immune niches was prognostic for local control, even without pSRS. Following pSRS, CD8 T cell and immune niche density were transiently reduced compared to untreated BrM, followed by a rebound 6+ days post pSRS with an increased frequency of TCF1- effector-like cells. In sum, pSRS is safe and therapeutically beneficial, and these data provide a framework for how pSRS may be leveraged to maximize intracranial CD8 T cell responses.",
Apatinib plus hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin and raltitrexed for hepatocellular carcinoma with extrahepatic metastasis: phase II trial,"Shiguang Chen, Xiangdong Wang, Bo Yuan, Jianyang Peng, Qingxian Zhang, Wenchang Yu, Naijian Ge, Zhicheng Weng, Jinqi Huang, Weifu Liu, Xiaolong Wang, Chuanben Chen",2024-10-14,"Most patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ultimately experience tumor progression after first-line systemic therapies. Systemic therapy is generally recommended as second-line treatment for advanced HCC in the major guidelines. Combining apatinib with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) likely drives synergistic activity on advanced HCC with extrahepatic metastasis. This phase II trial (ChiCTR2000029082) aimed to assess efficacy and safety of this combination in patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis who have progressed after first-line systemic therapies. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were progress-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), 6- and 12-month survival rates, overall survival (OS), and adverse events (AEs). Thirty-nine patients received oral treatment with apatinib, and hepatic artery infusion oxaliplatinplus raltitrexed. Per RECIST v1.1, the ORR and DCR was 53.8% and 89.7% in the patients population, respectively. The median PFS and OS was 6.2 months and 11.3 months, respectively. The 6- and 12-month survival rates were 81.7% and 44.1%, respectively. All AEs were manageable by medication or dose modifications. Apatinib plus HAIC for second-line therapy in advanced HCC with extrahepatic metastasis shows promising efficacy and manageable toxicities.",

Synthetic lethal strategies for the development of cancer therapeutics,"Natalie Y. L. Ngoi, David Gallo, Carlos Torrado, Mirella Nardo, Daniel Durocher, Timothy A. Yap",2024-12-03,"Synthetic lethality is a genetic phenomenon whereby the simultaneous presence of two different genetic alterations impairs cellular viability. Importantly, targeting synthetic lethal interactions offers potential therapeutic strategies for cancers with alterations in pathways that might otherwise be considered undruggable. High-throughput screening methods based on modern CRISPR–Cas9 technologies have emerged and become crucial for identifying novel synthetic lethal interactions with the potential for translation into biologically rational cancer therapeutic strategies as well as associated predictive biomarkers of response capable of guiding patient selection. Spurred by the clinical success of PARP inhibitors in patients with BRCA-mutant cancers, novel agents targeting multiple synthetic lethal interactions within DNA damage response pathways are in clinical development, and rational strategies targeting synthetic lethal interactions spanning alterations in epigenetic, metabolic and proliferative pathways have also emerged and are in late preclinical and/or early clinical testing. In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of established and emerging technologies for synthetic lethal drug discovery and development and discuss promising therapeutic strategies targeting such interactions.",
LLM-driven multimodal target volume contouring in radiation oncology,"Yujin Oh, Sangjoon Park, Hwa Kyung Byun, Yeona Cho, Ik Jae Lee, Jin Sung Kim, Jong Chul Ye",2024-10-24,"Target volume contouring for radiation therapy is considered significantly more challenging than the normal organ segmentation tasks as it necessitates the utilization of both image and text-based clinical information.

P. Huntly, Eshwar Meduri, Wolfram Ruf, Daniela S. Krause",2024-11-20,"Fibrinolysis influences the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells from their bone marrow microenvironment (BMM). Here we show that activation of plasmin, a key fibrinolytic agent, by annexin A2 (ANXA2) distinctly impacts progression of BCR-ABL1+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) via modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the BMM. The dense ECM in a BMM with decreased plasmin activity entraps insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 and reduces mTORC2-dependent signaling and proliferation of B-ALL cells. Conversely, B-ALL conditions the BMM to induce hepatic generation of plasminogen, the plasmin precursor. Treatment with ε-aminocaproic acid (EACA), which inhibits plasmin activation, reduces tumor burden and prolongs survival, including in xenogeneic models via increased fibronectin in the BMM. Human data confirm that IGF1 and fibronectin staining in trephine biopsies are correlated. Our studies suggest that fibrinolysis-mediated ECM remodeling and subsequent growth factor release influence B-ALL progression and inhibition of this process by EACA may be beneficial as adjunct therapy.",

In this phase 1/2 clinical trial (NCT05000372) involving a diverse cohort of 24 patients with solid tumors and lymphomas who received immunotherapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (either alone or with chemotherapies) and chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy, we examined the in vivo behaviors of 68Ga-grazytracer. Primary endpoints were safety, biodistribution, granzyme B specificity, and the predictive utility of 68Ga-grazytracer, while secondary endpoint was the relationship between 68Ga-grazytracer uptake and tumor immune phenotype. 68Ga-grazytracer exhibited a safe profile and specifically targeted granzyme B in patients. 68Ga-grazytracer PET showed superior predictive value for short-term prognosis and progression-free survival than those of conventional assessment criteria, including RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST. Moreover, the uptake of 68Ga-grazytracer in tumors was significantly higher in those with a “non-desert” immune phenotype than those with an immune “desert” phenotype, thereby meeting the primary and secondary endpoints of this trial. Collectively, we successfully visualized CD8+ T cell effector function in humans using 68Ga-grazytracer PET, offering insights for enhancing immunotherapy assessment, patient stratification and treatment planning.",

Yet, in-context learning remains underexplored in medical image analysis. Here, we systematically evaluate the model Generative Pretrained Transformer 4 with Vision capabilities (GPT-4V) on cancer image processing with in-context learning on three cancer histopathology tasks of high importance: Classification of tissue subtypes in colorectal cancer, colon polyp subtyping and breast tumor detection in lymph node sections. Our results show that in-context learning is sufficient to match or even outperform specialized neural networks trained for particular tasks, while only requiring a minimal number of samples. In summary, this study demonstrates that large vision language models trained on non-domain specific data can be applied out-of-the box to solve medical image-processing tasks in histopathology.

Choueiri, Chelsea Nichols, Deborah Schrag, Nikolaus Schultz",2024-11-12,"Databases that link molecular data to clinical outcomes can inform precision cancer research into novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers. However, outside of clinical trials, cancer outcomes are typically recorded only in text form within electronic health records (EHRs). Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been trained to extract outcomes from individual EHRs. However, patient privacy restrictions have historically precluded dissemination of these models beyond the centers at which they were trained. In this study, the vulnerability of text classification models trained directly on protected health information to membership inference attacks is confirmed. A teacher-student distillation approach is applied to develop shareable models for annotating outcomes from imaging reports and medical oncologist notes. ‘Teacher’ models trained on EHR data from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) are used to label imaging reports and discharge summaries from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV dataset. ‘Student’ models are trained to use these MIMIC documents to predict the labels assigned by teacher models and sent to Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) for evaluation. The student models exhibit high discrimination across outcomes in both the DFCI and MSK test sets. Leveraging private labeling of public datasets to distill publishable clinical AI models from academic centers could facilitate deployment of machine learning to accelerate precision oncology research.",

A pathologic response (primary objective) was observed in 5/10 patients, with 2 patients showing a major pathologic response. No patient achieved a complete pathologic response. A partial radiologic response (secondary objective) was observed in 3/10 patients, 5/10 patients had stable disease and 2/10 patients were non-evaluable on magnetic resonance imaging. All patients completed treatment without severe toxicity (exploratory objective). At median duration of follow-up of 22.5 months, two non-responders experienced disease recurrence. In-depth analysis of the loco-regional and systemic immune response (predefined exploratory objective) showed that monoclonal T cell expansion significantly correlated with treatment response. Tumour-draining lymph nodes displayed clonal overlap with intra-tumoural T cell expansion. All pre-specified endpoints, efficacy in terms of pathologic response as primary endpoint, radiologic response as secondary outcome and safety and tolerability as exploratory endpoint, were reached. Neoadjuvant ICB with pembrolizumab proved safe and induced pathologic, radiologic, and immunologic responses in MMRd EC, warranting further exploration of extended neoadjuvant treatment.",
Single-cell transcriptomics reveals over-activated reactive oxygen species pathway in hepatocytes in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma,"Xiaoping Wang, Penghui Li, Huicong Ji, Zhenzhen Xu, Huiwu Xing",2024-11-30,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly heterogeneous tumor and a primary cause of cancer-relevant deaths worldwide. The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HCC development is less studied. Methods: Seurat package and CellMarker database were employed for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis based on the GSE189175 dataset from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). DAVID and MsigDB database were utilized for pathway analysis. SCENIC analysis was performed to map a transcription factors (TFs) regulatory network. CellChat was used for cellular communication analysis. Results: Six major cell subpopulations were identified, among which hepatocytes accounted for the highest proportion in both cancer and adjacent tissues. The enrichment scores of the 50 hallmark gene sets showed that the ROS pathway was abnormally activated in HCC hepatocytes and positively correlated with energy metabolism-related pathways (glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, etc.). Then, the hepatocytes were divided into four subgroups. Noticeably, GPX4+  hepatocytes with the highest activity of the ROS pathway was related to a worse prognosis of HCC. Mechanism analysis revealed that JUND was involved in the positive regulation of the ROS pathway in GPX4+  hepatocytes. It was found that the interdependent ligand-receptor interaction between GPX4+  liver cells and immune cells facilitated the malignant development of HCC. Conclusion: ROS pathway was over-activated in the hepatocytes of HCC tissues. GPX4+  hepatocytes having the highest activity of the ROS pathway closely interacted with T cells and M2 macrophage cells. Molecular subtypes and risk score signature based on the ROS pathway and its potential target gene JUND are encouraged to be developed for improving the precision treatment of HCC.","Single-cell transcriptomics, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Reactive oxygen species pathway, GPX4+  HCC hepatocytes, CellChat"

Our results identify the spatial organization and immune status of the tumor-stroma boundary as a distinctive feature of dMMR and pMMR CRCs, which associates with ICB response. The physical interactions and abundance of LAMP3+DCs and CXCL13+T cells may shape the ICB-responsive tumor-stroma boundary, whereas CXCL14+cancer-associated fibroblasts tend to remodel extracellular matrix to form a structural barrier in non-responders. Our work therefore points out the importance of the molecular and cellular spatial structures of tumors in ICB response, raising the possibility of reprogramming tumor-stroma boundary for sensitizing immunotherapies in the majority of CRCs.",

However, this strategy has not been effective against solid tumors. Here, we describe the development of CAR T cells targeting p95HER2, a tumor-specific antigen found in HER2-amplified solid tumors. These CAR T cells display robust activity against p95HER2-expressing cell lines but demonstrate limited efficacy against patient-derived xenografts. As p95HER2 is invariably detectable on tumor cells that overexpress HER2, but not those that express HER2 at normal levels, we arm p95HER2-specific CAR T cells with affinity-tuned bispecific antibodies against HER2 and CD3 in order to redirect them only to HER2-amplified cells. The combination of p95HER2.CAR T cells and HER2 x CD3 bispecific antibodies lead to a complete regression in three HER2-positive, patient-derived mouse xenografts tumor models. This combination represents a promising strategy to redirect T cells against a subset of HER2-positive tumors.",

Dynamic FDG PET/CT for differentiating focal pelvic uptake in patients with gynecological cancer,"Sachimi Yamada, Tomoya Kotani, Nagara Tamaki, Yoshitomo Nakai, Yasuchiyo Toyama, Motoki Nishimura, Yasunori Nakamura, Takeshi Nii, Kei Yamada",2024-11-27,"This study aimed to evaluate the ability of serial whole-body dynamic PET/CT to differentiate physiological from abnormal 18F-FDG uptake in the abdomen and pelvis of gynecological cancer patients. We conducted a retrospective study of 61 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations for suspected gynecological malignancies or metastases between March 2018 and January 2020. Our protocol included four-phase dynamic whole-body scans. High-uptake foci with SUVmax > 2.5 in the abdominopelvic region caudal to the renal portal were picked up and visually evaluated as “changed” (disappeared during any phase or morphological changes in more than half of the foci) or “unchanged” in motion on the serial dynamic images. Focal 18F-FDG uptake was observed in 84 foci. Of the 58 foci determined pathologically or clinically to have pathological uptake, no change was observed on serial dynamic imaging in 54 foci (sensitivity, 93%). Of the 26 foci of physiological uptake, temporal changes in uptake were observed in 20 foci using dynamic imaging (specificity, 77%). The positive and negative predictive values were 90% and 83%, respectively, with an accuracy of 88%. Dynamic whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging allows for differentiation between pathological and physiological uptake in the abdominopelvic region of patients with gynecological cancer.","Whole-body PET/CT, 18F-FDG, Dynamic acquisition, Gynecological cancer, Physiological uptake"

In this study, we assessed the prognostic value of ctDNA-based MRD detection in LARC patients using a personalized, tumor-informed ctDNA assay. Plasma samples from LARC patients (N = 30) were analyzed retrospectively using the Signatera™ assay. The neoadjuvant rectal (NAR) score was calculated and compared to ctDNA status to predict recurrence risk and survival outcomes. ctDNA-positive patients post-NAT and post-surgery had worse Disease Free Survival (DFS) (HR: 7.82; p = 0.001, HR: 19.65; p = 0.001) when compared to ctDNA-negative patients. In the post-NAT setting, patients who responded to NAT had superior DFS compared to patients who did not clear their ctDNA or showed no radiological response (HR: 24.7, p = 0.001 and HR: 5.1, p = 0.054, respectively). When ctDNA status is used alongside the NAR score in the post-NAT setting, patients who were ctDNA-positive with an intermediate or high NAR score showed significantly worse DFS (HR: 47.5, p < 0.001) compared to ctDNA-negative patients with either a low or intermediate/high NAR score (HR: 9.8, p = 0.0301). Post-NAT ctDNA status, whether used alone or in combination with the NAR score, may predict NAT response, and improve risk stratification.","Circulating tumor DNA, Locally advanced rectal cancer, Biomarker, Neoadjuvant therapy, NAR score"

The genomic features of ICC in Chinese patients remain largely unknown. In this study, we perform deep whole-exome sequencing of 204 Chinese primary ICCs and characterize genomic alterations and clonal evolution, and reveal their associations with patient outcomes. We identify six mutational signatures, including Signatures A and F, which are highly similar to previously described signatures linked to aristolochic acid and aflatoxin exposures, respectively. We also identify 13 significantly mutated genes in the ICC samples, including SAV1. We find that SAV1 was mutated in 2.9% (20/672) of 672 ICC samples. SAV1 mutation is associated with lower SAV1 protein levels, higher rates of tumor recurrence, and shorter overall patient survival. Biofunctional investigations reveal a tumor-suppressor role of SAV1: its inactivation suppresses Hippo signaling, leading to YAP activation, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Collectively, our results delineate the genomic landscape of Chinese ICCs and identify SAV1 as a potential driver of ICC.",
Intrinsic temperature increase drives lipid metabolism towards ferroptosis evasion and chemotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer,"Vincent de Laat, Halit Topal, Xander Spotbeen, Ali Talebi, Jonas Dehairs, Jakub Idkowiak, Frank Vanderhoydonc, Tessa Ostyn, Peihua Zhao, Maarten Jacquemyn, Michele Wölk, Anna Sablina, Koen Augustyns, Tom Vanden Berghe, Tania Roskams, Dirk Daelemans, Maria Fedorova, Baki Topal, Johannes V. Swinnen",2024-10-02,"A spontaneously occurring temperature increase in solid tumors has been reported sporadically, but is largely overlooked in terms of cancer biology. Here we show that temperature is increased in tumors of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and explore how this could affect therapy response. By mimicking this observation in PDAC cell lines, we demonstrate that through adaptive changes in lipid metabolism, the temperature increase found in human PDAC confers protection to lipid peroxidation and contributes to gemcitabine resistance. Consistent with the recently uncovered role of p38 MAPK in ferroptotic cell death, we find that the reduction in lipid peroxidation potential following adaptation to tumoral temperature allows for p38 MAPK inhibition, conferring chemoresistance. As an increase in tumoral temperature is observed in several other tumor types, our findings warrant taking tumoral temperature into account in subsequent studies related to ferroptosis and therapy resistance. More broadly, our findings indicate that tumoral temperature affects cancer biology.",

With a median follow-up of 32.1 months, 18 (36.7%, 90% CI 25.3%–49.5%) of the 49 evaluable patients had an objective response, meeting the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included out-of-field (abscopal) response rate (ASR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). The ASR was 30.6% (95% CI 18.3%–45.4%). The median PFS and OS were 5.9 (95% CI 2.5–9.3) and 18.4 (95% CI 9.7–27.1) months, respectively. Any grade and grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 44 (86.3%) and 6 (11.8%) patients, without grade 4–5 TRAEs. Moreover, in pre-specified biomarker analyses, SBRT-induced increase of follicular helper T cells (Tfh) in unirradiated tumor lesions and patient’s blood, as well as of circulating IL-21 levels, was found associated with improved prognosis. Taken together, the triple combination therapy was well tolerated with promising efficacy and Tfh may play a critical role in SBRT-triggered anti-tumor immunity in metastatic NSCLC.",
Immunotherapy that improves response to chemotherapy in high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"Samar Elorbany, Chiara Berlato, Larissa S. Carnevalli, Eleni Maniati, Simon T.

Analysis of 64,097 cells identifies NACT-induced overexpression of stabilin-1 (clever-1) on macrophages and FOXP3 in Tregs that is confirmed at the protein level. STAB1 inhibition in vitro induces anti-tumour macrophages. FOXP3 anti-sense oligonucleotide (FOXP3-ASO), repolarises Tregs to an effector T cell phenotype. ScRNAseq on 69,781 cells from an HGSOC syngeneic mouse model recapitulates the patients’ data. Combining chemotherapy with anti-stabilin1 antibody and/or Foxp3-ASO significantly increases survival of mice with established peritoneal disease in two HGSOC syngeneic models and progression-free survival in a third model. Long-term survivors (300 days + ) are resistant to tumour rechallenge. Anti-stabilin1 antibody enriches the tumours with CXCL9+ macrophages and Foxp3-ASO increases TBET cell infiltration. Our results suggest that targeting these molecules in immune cells may improve chemotherapy response in patients.",

We evaluated the effects of the graphical display of cancer risk compared with those of numerical presentation on the decision-making for risk-reducing (RR) surgery. A total of 471 women representing the Korean population were recruited. The lifetime risk of breast/ovarian cancer were given numerically followed by graphically in hypothetical BRCA1/2 PV-positive cases. Subsequently, the study participants were asked for their willingness to undergo RRSO/RRM. When the ovarian cancer risk was shown as 44.0%, the percentage of study participants who chose RRSO was 41.0% after numerical presentation versus 39.9% after graphical display, of which the difference was not significant. When the breast cancer risk was presented as 72.0%, 30.4% of the participants opted for RRM under numerical presentation, whereas this increased to 38.6% under graphical display, of which the difference was significant (p < 0.0075). The average levels of the cancer risk which study participants consider RR surgery were 57.1% for ovarian cancer and 60.6% for breast cancer. This suggests that the impacts of different formats of risk communication on decision about RRSO or RRM may be different by the absolute levels of ovarian or breast cancer.","Genetic testing, BRCA, Graphical presentation, Breast cancer, Ovarian cancer"

A distinct three-classification system (neural, basal, mesenchymal) for ONB was established according to the distinguished gene expression patterns. Biomarkers for categorizing bulk tumors into uncharacterized subtypes were elucidated. Different responses towards certain chemotherapy regimens could be cautiously inferred according to the molecular features representing the three tumor types, thus helping with precision chemotherapy. We also analyzed subclusters of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the interactions among different cell types within the TME.

Single center evaluation of sensitivity and specificity of CellDetect assay in early bladder cancer patients,"Wenbo Gao, Zhiling Lou",2024-11-24,"Until recently, the main diagnostic methods for bladder cancer (BC) are still voided urine cytology and cystoscopy, and many drawbacks persist. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of the CellDetect assay in the detection of BC with comparison to standard diagnostic methods. Between August 2020 and July 2022, B-ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) scan was performed for patients with hematuria or irritative voiding symptoms. If no bladder mass was detected, the patient was excluded. A total of 148 patients with bladder mass formed the final study cohort. The patients’ urine samples were measured with CellDetect assay, followed by cystoscopy or diagnostic transurethral resection of bladder tumor. The patients were divided into two groups based on previous history of BC: group P and group R. The analysis included descriptive statistics and percentages. Finally, 115 cases had a positive CellDetect result, with 68 cases in group P and 47 in group R, respectively. And 134 cases revealed malignant tumor pathologically. The overall sensitivity and specificity for all patients were 82.1% and 64.2%, respectively. Concerning the subgroups, the respective sensitivity and specificity were: in group P- 81.0% and 50.0%; and in group R- 85.2% and 83.3%, respectively. In conclusion, CellDetect assay demonstrated significant performance for diagnosis of BC: it can identify BC patients at early stage with significant diagnostic performance and good reliability. This assay might develop novel methods and ideas for future clinical practice.",
FBP1 over-expression suppresses HIF-1α in papillary thyroid cancer,"Huashui Li, Wenjun Xie, Xiangqin Huang, Yifan Chen",2024-11-25,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is generally a slow-growing disease with a favorable 10-year survival rate. However, about 10% of PTC cases show significant aggressiveness, with tendencies for local invasion or distant metastasis, the mechanisms of which remain unclear. This study aims to identify predictive indicators and explore new potential targets for clinical treatment, highlighting the need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We analyzed FBP1 expression in PTC tissues. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion were evaluated with and without FBP1 overexpression in PTC cells to assess FBP1’s effects. We then investigated whether FBP1 reduces PTC cell tumorigenesis and metastasis by regulating HIF-1α expression. FBP1 expression was reduced in PTC samples and showed a negative correlation with T stage. In vitro experiments indicated that FBP1 acts as a hypoxia response inhibitor, regulating tumor cells. Additionally, FBP1 inhibited the proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells by modulating HIF-1α expression.  Our results provide new insights into the role of FBP1 in PTC progression and indicate that targeting the FBP1-HIF-1α axis could be a promising therapeutic approach for this disease.","Papillary thyroid tumor, FBP1, HIF-1α, Hypoxia"

The algorithm was developed and calibrated in a 2D model and 3D anthropomorphic bladder phantom. The performance was evaluated in vivo in swine and with retrospective clinical cystoscopy video. Results showed that the algorithm was capable of capturing and stitching intravesical images with different sweeping patterns. Between 93% and 99% of frames had sufficient features for bladder map generation. Upon reevaluation, the cystoscope accurately localized a frame within 4.5 s. In swine, a virtual mucosal surface map was generated that matched the explant anatomy. A surface map could be generated based on archived patient cystoscopy images. This tool could aid recording and referencing pathologic findings and biopsy or treatment locations for subsequent procedures and may have utility in patients with metachronous bladder cancer and in low-resource settings.","Bladder map, Image stitching, Cystoscope, Cystoscopy"

Nomogram for predicting all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality after TURBT for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer,"Yao Luo, Sujing Wei, Jing Yang, Zaixiang Tan",2024-11-20,"The main purpose of this study was to construct two nomograms to predict all-cause mortality (ACM) and cause-specific mortality (CSM) in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients after transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBTs). We selected NMIBC patients who underwent TURBT between 2004 and 2017 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The patients were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set at a ratio of 7:3. The independent influencing factors of ACM and CSM in the training set were determined by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. We then integrated those independent influencing factors to construct nomograms. These prediction nomograms were further verified in the validation set. The C-index, calibration curve, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve were used to evaluate the identification, calibration, predictive ability and clinical effectiveness of the nomograms. A total of 28,086 cases were ultimately included in this study, which were divided into a training set (19,661 individuals) and a validation set (8425 individuals). Nine variables, including age at diagnosis, race, marital status, tumor grade, T stage, tumor size, number of tumors, and primary site, were obtained via multivariate Cox regression of the training set and used to construct two nomograms prediction model. The C-index values for the ACM nomogram were 0.743 and 0.741 for the training and validation sets, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding values of the C-index for the CSM nomogram were 0.785 and 0.786, respectively. The ROC curves, calibration curves, and DCA curves showed good predictive performance.

IL36G-producing neutrophil-like monocytes promote cachexia in cancer,"Yoshihiro Hayashi, Yasushige Kamimura-Aoyagi, Sayuri Nishikawa, Rena Noka, Rika Iwata, Asami Iwabuchi, Yushin Watanabe, Natsumi Matsunuma, Kanako Yuki, Hiroki Kobayashi, Yuka Harada, Hironori Harada",2024-09-12,"Most patients with advanced cancer develop cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive skeletal muscle wasting. Despite its catastrophic impact on survival, the critical mediators responsible for cancer cachexia development remain poorly defined. Here, we show that a distinct subset of neutrophil-like monocytes, which we term cachexia-inducible monocytes (CiMs), emerges in the advanced cancer milieu and promotes skeletal muscle loss. Unbiased transcriptome analysis reveals that interleukin 36 gamma (IL36G)-producing CD38+ CiMs are induced in chronic monocytic blood cancer characterized by prominent cachexia. Notably, the emergence of CiMs and the activation of CiM-related gene signatures in monocytes are confirmed in various advanced solid cancers. Stimuli of toll-like receptor 4 signaling are responsible for the induction of CiMs. Genetic inhibition of IL36G-mediated signaling attenuates skeletal muscle loss and rescues cachexia phenotypes in advanced cancer models. These findings indicate that the IL36G-producing subset of neutrophil-like monocytes could be a potential therapeutic target in cancer cachexia.",

Patients with discordant clinical risk and MammaPrint genomic risk classification were randmomized to receive chemotherapy based on either the clinical or the genomic risk assessment. Endocrine therapy treatment was based on local guidelines. 715/6693 (10.7%) MINDACT patients had HR+, HER2-, T1abN0 breast cancer and were included in this analysis. All were clinically low-risk, 124/715 (17.3%) were genomic high-risk. For genomic high-risk tumors, 8-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was 92.9% (95% CI 86.2–96.4%) compared to 95.0% (95% CI 92.8–96.6%) for genomic low-risk tumors. For genomic high-risk tumors treated with or without chemotherapy, 8-year DMFS was 89.2% (95% CI 73.6–95.8%) and 94.1% (95% CI 82.9–98.1%), respectively. For genomic low-risk tumors, the 8-year DMFS and disease-free survival (DFS) were 96.1% (95% CI 93.4–97.6%) and 89.3% (95% CI 85.5–92.2%) when treated with endocrine therapy and 92.9% (95% CI 87.9–95.9%) and 79.4% (95% CI 72.5–84.8%) without. In conclusion, although the number of randomized patients is small, patients with small, genomic high-risk breast cancer did not seem to derive benefit from chemotherapy. Endocrine therapy was associated with improved outcomes even in genomic low-risk breast cancers.",
Timing of whole genome duplication is associated with tumor-specific MHC-II depletion in serous ovarian cancer,"Nikki L. Burdett, Madelynne O. Willis, Ahwan Pandey, Laura Twomey, Sara Alaei, Australian Ovarian Cancer Study Group, David D. L. Bowtell, Elizabeth L. Christie",2024-07-18,"Whole genome duplication is frequently observed in cancer, and its prevalence in our prior analysis of end-stage, homologous recombination deficient high grade serous ovarian cancer (almost 80% of samples) supports the notion that whole genome duplication provides a fitness advantage under the selection pressure of therapy. Here, we therefore aim to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in primary high grade serous ovarian cancer with whole genome duplication by assessing differentially expressed genes and pathways in 79 samples. We observe that MHC-II expression is lowest in tumors which have acquired whole genome duplication early in tumor evolution, and further demonstrate that reduced MHC-II expression occurs in subsets of tumor cells rather than in canonical antigen-presenting cells. Early whole genome duplication is also associated with worse patient survival outcomes. Our results suggest an association between the timing of whole genome duplication, MHC-II expression and clinical outcome in high grade serous ovarian cancer that warrants further investigation for therapeutic targeting.",
CRISPR/Cas9 editing of NKG2A improves the efficacy of primary CD33-directed chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cells,"Tobias Bexte, Nawid Albinger, Ahmad Al Ajami, Philipp Wendel, Leon Buchinger, Alec Gessner, Jamal Alzubi, Vinzenz Särchen, Meike Vogler, Hadeer Mohamed Rasheed, Beate Anahita Jung, Sebastian Wolf, Raj Bhayadia, Thomas Oellerich, Jan-Henning Klusmann, Olaf Penack, Nina Möker, Toni Cathomen, Michael A. Rieger, Katharina Imkeller, Evelyn Ullrich",2024-09-30,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified natural killer (NK) cells show antileukemic activity against acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in vivo. However, NK cell-mediated tumor killing is often impaired by the interaction between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-E and the inhibitory receptor, NKG2A. Here, we describe a strategy that overcomes CAR-NK cell inhibition mediated by the HLA-E-NKG2A immune checkpoint. We generate CD33-specific, AML-targeted CAR-NK cells (CAR33) combined with CRISPR/Cas9-based gene disruption of the NKG2A-encoding KLRC1 gene. Using single-cell multi-omics analyses, we identified transcriptional features of activation and maturation in CAR33-KLRC1ko-NK cells, which are preserved following exposure to AML cells. Moreover, CAR33-KLRC1ko-NK cells demonstrate potent antileukemic killing activity against AML cell lines and primary blasts in vitro and in vivo. We thus conclude that NKG2A-deficient CAR-NK cells have the potential to bypass immune suppression in AML.",
"Selinexor combined with bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease","Junjing Yin, Xia Zhou, Xuemei Li, Chenglu Yuan, Xiaoxia Chu, Lumei Hao, Hongying Wu, Yuping Zhong",2024-11-19,"Objective: We aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of Selinexor combined bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (XVRd) protocol in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease. Methods: This is a single-arm, open, observational clinical study. For induction/consolidation(21-day cycles), patients received 8 cycles of XVRd protocol. In maintenance (28-day cycles), patients received XR (Selinexor + Lenalidomide) at least 2 years until disease progression, death or withdrawal. The primary endpoints were overall response rates and minimal residual disease negative rates. Results: The median age of the 10 patients was 62 (range 55–81) years. R-ISS stage 3 was present in 2 (20%) patients. 3 patients had high risk cytogenetic and 1 patient with plasma cell leukocyte. According to IMWG criteria, the ORR of 10 patients with NDMM was 100%, including 2 stringent complete response (sCR), 2 complete remission (CR), 4 very good partial response (VGPR) and 2 partial response (PR). Median progression-free survival and overall survival were not achieved. The most common grade 3–4 treatment-emergent adverse events (occurring in 10% of patients) were thrombocytopenia. The most common non-hematological adverse events were grade 1 or 2, including nausea (30%), fatigue (40%), and anorexia (20%). Overall, the severe toxicities were manageable. Conclusion: The XVRd regimen had good efficacy and safety in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease.","Multiple myeloma, Selinexor, Extramedullary disease"
Increased cell killing effect in neutron capture enhanced proton beam therapy,"Shintaro Shiba, Takahiro Shimo, Masashi Yamanaka, Takayuki Yagihashi, Makoto Sakai, Tatsuya Ohno, Koichi Tokuuye, Motoko Omura",2024-11-18,"Thermal neutrons generated in the body during proton beam therapy (PBT) can be used to cause boron neutron capture reactions and have recently been proposed as neutron capture enhanced PBT (NCEPBT). However, the cell killing effect of NCEPBT remains underexplored. Here, we show an increase in the cell killing effect of NCEPBT. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we showed that neutrons generated by proton beam irradiation are uniformly spread on tissue culture plates. Human salivary gland tumor cell line (HSG), human osteosarcoma cell line (MG63), human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SAS), and human malignant melanoma cell line (G-361) were irradiated with X-rays, proton beams, and proton beams with 10B-enriched  boronophenylalanine (boron concentration of 20 and 80 ppm). The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values of proton beams alone, proton beams with 20 ppm boron, and proton beams with 80 ppm boron for HSG, MG63, SAS, and G-361 were 1.02, 1.07, and 1.23; 1.01, 1.08, and 1.44; 1.05, 1.09, and 1.46; and 1.04, 1.13, and 1.63, respectively. NCEPBT with high boron concentration showed high RBE and a high sensitizing effect. Our results confirm an increase in the cell killing effect of NCEPBT, should aid in its clinical use, and warrant its further investigation.","Proton beam therapy, Neutron capture enhanced proton beam therapy, Radiotherapy, Boron neutron capture reaction, Boron neutron capture therapy, Boronophenylalanine"
Multi-omics with dynamic network biomarker algorithm prefigures organ-specific metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma,"Xiaoshen Zhang, Kai Xiao, Yaokai Wen, Fengying Wu, Guanghui Gao, Luonan Chen, Caicun Zhou",2024-11-14,"Efficacious strategies for early detection of lung cancer metastasis are of significance for improving the survival of lung cancer patients. Here we show the marker genes and serum secretome foreshadowing the lung cancer site-specific metastasis through dynamic network biomarker (DNB) algorithm, utilizing two clinical cohorts of four major types of lung cancer distant metastases, with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of primary lesions and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry data of sera. Also, we locate the intermediate status of cancer cells, along with its gene signatures, in each metastatic state trajectory that cancer cells at this stage still have no specific organotropism. Furthermore, an integrated neural network model based on the filtered scRNA-seq data is successfully constructed and validated to predict the metastatic state trajectory of cancer cells. Overall, our study provides an insight to locate the pre-metastasis status of lung cancer and primarily examines its clinical application value, contributing to the early detection of lung cancer metastasis in a more feasible and efficacious way.",
Genomic and immune heterogeneity of multiple synchronous lung adenocarcinoma at different developmental stages,"Yue Zhao, Jian Gao, Jun Wang, Fanfan Fan, Chao Cheng, Danwen Qian, Ran Guo, Yang Zhang, Ting Ye, Marcellus Augustine, Yicong Lin, Jun Shang, Hang Li, Yunjian Pan, Qingyuan Huang, Haiqing Chen, Han Han, Zhendong Gao, Qiming Wang, Shiyue Zhang, Mou Zhang, Fangqiu Fu, Yueren Yan, Shanila Fernandez Patel, Roberto Vendramin, Hui Yuan, Yawei Zhang, Jiaqing Xiang, Hong Hu, Yihua Sun, Yuan Li, Kevin Litchfield, Zhiwei Cao, Haiquan Chen",2024-09-10,"Multiple synchronous lung cancers (MSLCs) constitute a unique subtype of lung cancer. To explore the genomic and immune heterogeneity across different pathological stages of MSLCs, we analyse 16 MSLCs from 8 patients using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell TCR sequencing, and bulk whole-exome sequencing. Our investigation indicates clonally independent tumours with convergent evolution driven by shared driver mutations. However, tumours from the same individual exhibit few shared mutations, indicating independent origins. During the transition from pre-invasive to invasive adenocarcinoma, we observe a shift in T cell phenotypes characterized by increased Treg cells and exhausted CD8+ T cells, accompanied by diminished cytotoxicity. Additionally, invasive adenocarcinomas exhibit greater neoantigen abundance and a more diverse TCR repertoire, indicating heightened heterogeneity. In summary, despite having a common genetic background and environmental exposure, our study emphasizes the individuality of MSLCs at different stages, highlighting their unique genomic and immune characteristics.",
Phase II study of uPAR-PET/CT for staging of primary breast cancer in comparison with ultrasound and fine needle biopsies,"Marie Øbro Fosbøl, Esben Andreas Carlsen, Malene Brandt-Larsen, Camilla Christensen, Jacob Madsen, Annika Loft, Anne Kiil Berthelsen, Tove Filtenborg Tvedskov, Niels Kroman, Kim Francis Andersen, Eric von Benzon, Andreas Kjaer",2024-10-30,"Accurate initial staging of patients with breast cancer is essential for planning optimal treatment strategies. However, currently, no imaging modality is able to detect lymph node metastases preoperatively with sufficient reliability; therefore, the N status depends on the sentinel node procedure for ~ 70% of patients. In a prospective clinical trial of breast cancer patients, we compared head-to-head uPAR-PET/CT with current standard-of-care, ultrasound (US) and fine needle biopsy (FNB) as staging methods. Forty-nine patients (48 women and 1 man) with biopsy-proven early breast cancer underwent uPAR-PET/CT prior to surgery. All image data were analyzed by two separate teams, each consisting of a highly experienced certified specialist in nuclear medicine and a highly experienced certified specialist in radiology for visualization of primary tumor lesions and detection of lymph node and distant metastases. Histopathological assessment and verification of malignancy in the excised tissues (primary tumors and lymph nodes) were considered standard-of-truth. On a per patient basis, uPAR PET/CT demonstrated a sensitivity of 94% [CI: 83–99%] for detecting the primary tumor (both teams). For the detection of axillary lymph nodes the pooled sensitivity of uPAR PET/CT was 33.3% [CI: 16.5–54.0%], specificity 87.0% [CI: 66.4–97.2%] and accuracy 58.0% [CI: 43.2–71.8%]. In comparison, the standard-of-care preoperative clinical staging algorithm with US and FNB had a sensitivity of 41% [CI: 22–61%] and specificity of 100% [CI: 85–100%] for axillary lymph node metastases. We conclude that the results do not support the use of uPAR PET/CT for staging in breast cancer patients. However, the finding that 94% of primary tumors were uPAR-PET positive may be encouraging for pursuing uPAR theranostics in localized disease. Additionally, other potential applications, such as using uPAR-PET as a prognostic imaging biomarker of tumor aggressiveness, remain to be investigated.",

Postoperatively patients continued assigned treatment for a maximum of 2 years. Postoperative bevacizumab was optional. The primary endpoint was independently assessed CRR at interval debulking surgery. Secondary endpoints were Completeness of Cytoreduction Index (CCI) and peritoneal cancer index (PCI) scores, objective and best response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety, postoperative morbidity, and pathological complete response. The CRR in 61 pembrolizumab-treated patients was 74% (one-sided 95% CI = 63%), exceeding the prespecified ≥50% threshold and meeting the primary objective. The CRR without pembrolizumab was 70% (one-sided 95% CI = 54%). In the remaining patients CCI scores were ≥3 in 27% of the standard-of-care group and 18% of the investigational group and CC1 in 3% of the investigational group. PCI score decreased by a mean of 9.6 in the standard-of-care group and 10.2 in the investigational group. Objective response rates were 60% and 72%, respectively, and best overall response rates were 83% and 90%, respectively. Progression-free survival was similar with the two regimens (median 20.8 versus 19.4 months in the standard-of-care versus investigational arms, respectively) but overall survival favored pembrolizumab-containing therapy (median 35.3 versus 49.8 months, respectively). The most common grade ≥3 adverse events with pembrolizumab-containing therapy were anemia during neoadjuvant therapy and infection/fever postoperatively. Pembrolizumab was discontinued prematurely because of adverse events in 23% of pembrolizumab-treated patients. Combining pembrolizumab with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is feasible for HGSC considered not completely resectable; observed activity in some subgroups justifies further evaluation to improve understanding of the role of immunotherapy in HGSC.",

Using nasopharyngeal carcinoma as a model, here we analyse single-cell transcriptomes of 343,829 cells from 77 biopsy and blood samples and spatially-resolved transcriptomes of 31,316 spots from 15 tumours to decipher their components and interactions with tumour cell aggregates. We identify essential cell populations in tertiary lymphoid structure, including CXCL13+ cancer-associated fibroblasts, stem-like CXCL13+CD8+ T cells, and B and T follicular helper cells. Our study shows that germinal centre reaction matures plasma cells. These plasma cells intersperse with tumour cell aggregates, promoting apoptosis of EBV-related malignant cells and enhancing immunotherapy response. CXCL13+ cancer-associated fibroblasts promote B cell adhesion and antibody production, activating CXCL13+CD8+ T cells that become exhausted in tumour cell aggregates. Tertiary lymphoid structure-related cell signatures correlate with prognosis and PD-1 blockade response, offering insights for therapeutic strategies in cancers.",

Patients with stage II/III early breast cancer planning to undergo adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive PG2 500 mg or placebo on days 1, 3, and 8 every 21 days. The fatigue global score (FGS) was assessed using the brief fatigue inventory (BFI)-Taiwan. The Breast Cancer-Specific Module of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires-Core30 evaluated the health-related quality of life during the first four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. Overall, 66 eligible patients were equally randomized into the PG2 and placebo groups between March 01, 2018, and March 09, 2021. The mean change in the FGS and fatigue intensity did not significantly differ between both groups. However, the FGS and fatigue intensity were less aggravated in the first four cycles in the premenopausal-PG2 group than in the placebo group. Our study concluded PG2 combined with adjuvant chemotherapy can reduce CIF, insomnia, the negative effect on future perspectives, and improve global health status, especially for premenopausal patients with breast cancer. Trial registration number: NCT03314805 registered on 19/10/2017.","Astragalus polysaccharides, Cancer-related fatigue, Chemotherapy-related fatigue, Breast cancer, Adjuvant chemotherapy"

Patients with HER2(+) EBC who received NAST between 1 Jan 2019 and 31 Jan 2022 were reviewed. IDFS was defined as the time from surgery until first occurrence of invasive breast cancer recurrence, distant recurrence, or death from any cause. The total cohort was 594 patients. pCR (ypT0/isN0) was achieved in 325(55%) and RD was seen in 269(45%) patients. In 269 patients with RD, 45(17%) did not have HER2 retesting and were excluded. In the remaining 224 patients, 143(64%) were HER2(+) and 81(36%) were HER2(−). With a median follow up of 24 months, 8 patients developed BM at initial recurrence, 4/325(1.2%) with pCR and 4/143(2.8%) with HER2(+) RD. IDFS events occurred in 22/594(3%) patients; 14/269(5%) in RD and 8/325(2%) in pCR (p = 0.04). There was no difference in IDFS between 9/143(6%) patients with HER2(+) RD or 5/81(6%) with HER2(−) RD (p = 0.10). Patients with RD had higher IDFS events than those with pCR. In those with RD, 36% lost HER2(+) status; IDFS events appeared similar in those with HER2(+) RD versus those with HER2(−) RD. The BM events seen in those with RD and pCR highlights the need for more effective therapy in NAST and adjuvant setting to minimize BM risk.",

Using this difference as an example, we queried the mechanism(s) behind the proclivity for organ-specific metastasis. We used spontaneous and implant models of metastatic mammary carcinoma coupled with inflammatory tissue fibrosis, single-cell sequencing analyses and functional studies to unravel the causal determinants of organ-specific metastasis. Here we show that lung metastasis is facilitated by angiopoietin 2 (Ang2)-mediated suppression of lung-specific endothelial tight junction protein Claudin 5, which is augmented by the inflammatory fibrotic microenvironment and prevented by anti-Ang2 blocking antibodies, while kidney metastasis is prevented by non-Ang2-responsive Claudins 2 and 10. Suppression of Claudins 2 and 10 was sufficient to induce the emergence of kidney metastasis. This study illustrates the influence of organ-specific vascular heterogeneity in determining organotropic metastasis, independent of cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms.",
Basal-to-inflammatory transition and tumor resistance via crosstalk with a pro-inflammatory stromal niche,"Nancy Yanzhe Li, Weiruo Zhang, Daniel Haensel, Anna R. Jussila, Cory Pan, Sadhana Gaddam, Sylvia K. Plevritis, Anthony E. Oro",2024-09-17,"Cancer-associated inflammation is a double-edged sword possessing both pro- and anti-tumor properties through ill-defined tumor-immune dynamics. While we previously identified a carcinoma tumor-intrinsic resistance pathway, basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition, here, employing a multipronged single-cell and spatial-omics approach, we identify an inflammation and therapy-enriched tumor state we term basal-to-inflammatory transition. Basal-to-inflammatory transition signature correlates with poor overall patient survival in many epithelial tumors. Basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition and basal-to-inflammatory transition occur in adjacent but distinct regions of a single tumor: basal-to-squamous cell carcinoma transition arises within the core tumor nodule, while basal-to-inflammatory transition emerges from a specialized inflammatory environment defined by a tumor-associated TREM1 myeloid signature. TREM1 myeloid-derived cytokines IL1 and OSM induce basal-to-inflammatory transition in vitro and in vivo through NF-κB, lowering sensitivity of patient basal cell carcinoma explant tumors to Smoothened inhibitor treatment. This work deepens our knowledge of the heterogeneous local tumor microenvironment and nominates basal-to-inflammatory transition as a drug-resistant but targetable tumor state driven by a specialized inflammatory microenvironment.",

Eligible patients with colorectal cancer (Cohort A) or noncolorectal and nonesophageal GI cancer (Cohort C) received six cycles of anlotinib plus standard chemotherapeutic regimens followed by anlotinib plus metronomic capecitabine as a maintenance therapy. Liver metastasectomy can be performed when liver metastases are converted to resectable lesions. The primary outcome was the investigator-confirmed objective response rate (ORR) in the intention-to-treat population. Among the 47 patients in Cohort A, the ORR was 40.4% (95% CI 26.4–55.7), including 1 with a complete response (CR) and 18 who achieved a partial response (PR). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.7 months (95% CI 7.3-NE), and the median overall survival (OS) was not reached. In Cohort C, 14 of 44 patients achieved a PR, with an ORR of 31.8% (95% CI 18.6–47.6). The PFS and OS were 5.8 months (95% CI 4.8–6.5) and 11.4 months (95% CI 5.8–19.3), respectively. The liver metastasectomy rate in patients with liver-limited disease was 22.7% (5/22) in Cohort A and 6.7% (2/30) in Cohort C. For pancreatic cancer patients, the ORR of the efficacy-evaluable population was 36.0% (9/25), and those with liver-limited metastasis had better survival. Moreover, no new safety concerns emerged. In conclusion, an anlotinib-based first-line regimen demonstrated promising antitumor activity among GI cancer patients with unresectable liver metastases and led to liver metastasectomy in selected patients.",

Here, we show an expansion of MDS hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with a granulo-monocytic-biased transcriptional differentiation state in MDS patients who initially responded to venetoclax but eventually relapsed. While MDS HSCs in an undifferentiated cellular state are sensitive to venetoclax treatment, differentiation towards a granulo-monocytic-biased transcriptional state, through the acquisition or expansion of clones with STAG2 or RUNX1 mutations, affects HSCs’ survival dependence from BCL2-mediated anti-apoptotic pathways to TNFα-induced pro-survival NF-κB signaling and drives resistance to venetoclax-mediated cytotoxicity. Our findings reveal how hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) can eventually overcome therapy-induced depletion and underscore the importance of using close molecular monitoring to prevent HSPC hierarchical change in MDS patients enrolled in clinical trials of venetoclax.",
Genetic features and therapeutic relevance of emergent circulating tumor DNA alterations in refractory non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers,"David Hsiehchen, Leslie Bucheit, Dong Yang, Muhammad Shaalan Beg, Mir Lim, Sunyoung S. Lee, Pashtoon Murtaza Kasi, Ahmed O. Kaseb, Hao Zhu",2022-12-03,"Acquired resistance to systemic treatments is inevitable in most cancers, but the genetic basis for this in many cancer types has remained elusive due to constraints in obtaining tissue specimens longitudinally. In the management of gastrointestinal cancers, molecular profiling is conventionally performed at a single time point, although serial evaluations may yield biological insights that inform treatment decisions. We characterize genetic changes in serial liquid biopsies which provide real-time snapshots of tumor genetics and heterogeneity in refractory non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancers, and determine the clinical utility of repeat circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing. In a national cohort of 449 patients with pancreatic, biliary, esophagogastric, and hepatocellular cancers, resistance to conventional therapies is broadly associated with tumor evolution. Emergent ctDNA alterations only detectable at progression occurs in 63% of patients and are frequently associated with treatment actionability. Tumor mutation burden is dynamic in cancers undergoing treatment, but is not associated with time to progression. Objective tumor responses in a case series of patients receiving treatment matched to emergent alterations show that repeat liquid biopsies may have clinical benefit by expanding treatment options in advanced gastrointestinal cancers.",
Optimizing focused very-high-energy electron beams for radiation therapy based on Monte Carlo simulation,"Chaofan An, Wei Zhang, Zeyi Dai, Jia Li, Xiong Yang, Jike Wang, Yuancun Nie",2024-11-11,"A TOPAS-based optimization program has been developed to precisely concentrate the dose of focused very-high-energy electron (VHEE) beams on deep-seated targets. This is accomplished by optimizing the magnetic gradients, positions, and number of quadrupole magnets within TOPAS. Using only three quadrupole magnets, the program focuses 250 MeV VHEE beams to achieve a maximum dose position deeper than 17 cm, while maintaining entrance and exit doses within 25% and limiting the lateral dimensions to ≤ 1 cm at the maximum dose location. The linear relationship between the magnetic gradient of the last quadrupole magnet and the maximum dose position enables dose location adjustments through gradient variation. Multiple positions were validated in TOPAS with errors within 1%. The spread-out electron peak (SOEP) is achieved by combining two VHEE beams with different maximum dose positions using the differential evolution method, covering a target depth of 12–17 cm and attaining a dose flatness better than 99%. This pioneering program imposes constraints on entrance dose, exit dose, maximum dose position, and the lateral dimensions of dose deposition at the maximum dose position within phantom. This program may be a promising tool in the applications of focused VHEE in highly conformal treatment plans based on TOPAS.","Focused VHEE, FLASH-radiotherapy, Spread-out electron peak (SOEP)"
Spatial transcriptomics reveals strong association between SFRP4 and extracellular matrix remodeling in prostate cancer,"Maria K. Andersen, Sebastian Krossa, Elise Midtbust, Christine A.

Rye, May-Britt Tessem",2024-11-08,"Prostate tumor heterogeneity is a major obstacle when studying the biological mechanisms of molecular markers. Increased gene expression levels of secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (SFRP4) is a biomarker in aggressive prostate cancer. To understand how SFRP4 relates to prostate cancer we performed comprehensive spatial and multiomics analysis of the same prostate cancer tissue samples. The experimental workflow included spatial transcriptomics, bulk transcriptomics, proteomics, DNA methylomics and tissue staining. SFRP4 mRNA was predominantly located in cancer stroma, produced by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, and co-expressed with extracellular matrix components. We also confirmed that higher SFRP4 gene expression is associated with cancer aggressiveness. Gene expression of SFRP4 was affected by gene promotor methylation. Surprisingly, the high mRNA levels did not reflect SFRP4 protein levels, which was much lower. This study contributes previously unknown insights of SFRP4 mRNA in the prostate tumor environment that potentially can improve diagnosis and treatment.",
Safety and aesthetic evaluation of autologous dermal fat grafts for lateral Skull base defect reconstruction,"Xu Tian, Yu Huang, Zhiqiang Gao, Yang Zhao, Liqin Zhang, Huiying Sun, Guodong Feng, Yu Chen",2024-11-09,"ObjectiveThe selection of appropriate materials and techniques for reconstructing skull base defects is crucial for restoring function, minimizing complications, and enhancing aesthetics. Dermal fat grafts (DFGs) have been established in many surgeries for contour correction. However, there is little literature describing the application of free dermal fat grafts for reconstruction of lateral skull base surgery defects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effect of using free dermal fat grafts in the reconstruction of lateral skull base defects.MethodsIn this study, 32 patients who underwent primary autologous free dermal fat graft reconstruction for lateral skull base defects were enrolled. Postoperative complications both in the donor and recipient area were evaluated. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction techniques were applied to visualize the fat graft shape and volume variations for the assessment of postoperative restoring function. A telephone questionnaire was used for the assessment of postoperative facial aesthetics and patient satisfaction.ResultsA total of 32 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in the study, showing satisfying results in safety and aesthetics. Participants’ ages averaged at 42.03 years, with the youngest being 18 and the oldest at 75 years old. No patient had postoperative complications of abdominal wounds in the donor area, only two patients had postoperative infections and one patient had a postoperative effusion in the recipient area. The volume of the grafts ranged from a minimum of 24.4 cm³ to a maximum of 131 cm³, with the highest recorded resorption volume being 33.63 cm³. The average resorption rate of the dermal fat graft was 24.36%, ranging from a minimum of 11% to a maximum of 43%. 3D reconstruction based on MRI imaging data indicated that DFGs have a lower resorption rate than traditional free fat grafts. The telephone questionnaire revealed high patient satisfaction with facial aesthetics, with the majority rating their outcomes positively.ConclusionsDermal fat grafts have fewer complication and can provide better resistance to infection and radiation aspect. Based on 3D reconstruction techniques via MRI imaging data, we found that dermal fat grafts have lower resorption rate than traditional free fat grafts, which can be a suitable material for reconstruction of lateral skull base defects.","Lateral skull base defect, Fat graft, Reconstructive surgery, 3D reconstruction"
Evaluation of thermal effects of surgical energy devices: ex vivo study,"Toshiharu Morikawa, Shuzo Hamamoto, Masakazu Gonda, Kazumi Taguchi, Rei Unno, Koei Torii, Masahiko Isogai, Kengo Kawase, Takashi Nagai, Shoichiro Iwatsuki, Toshiki Etani, Taku Naiki, Atsushi Okada, Takahiro Yasui",2024-11-09,"This study evaluated the direct and indirect thermal effects of various surgical energy devices using an ex-vivo model. Two types of three devices were evaluated: ENSEAL™ X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer (X1) and ENSEAL™ G2 Curved Tissue Sealer (G2) as vessel sealing systems (VSSs), and HARMONIC® HD1000i Shears (HA) as an ultrasonic activating device (USAD). Each device was activated once under DRY or WET conditions. The tissue’s maximum temperature (MT), steam MT surrounding the activation site, and steam spread area (SSA) were measured. Under WET conditions, the median MT of a porcine common carotid artery at 1 mm from the activation site by X1, G2, and HA were 84.4, 83.3, and 50.5 °C, respectively. The direct thermal effect of HA was the lowest among the three devices. VSSs showed higher tissue MT under WET conditions compared with DRY conditions. Conversely, USAD showed the opposite trend. G2 demonstrated a significantly higher MT than X1 and HA (P < 0.05). A significant decrease in SSA was observed with decreasing grasping range. In conclusion, VSSs generated higher temperatures than USAD, especially under WET conditions. Surgeons should consider minimizing thermal effects by creating DRY conditions or performing gradual incisions when using VSS devices.","Vessel sealing system, Ultrasonic activating device, Thermal effect, Grasping range, Steam spread area, WET condition"

Turner",2024-11-05,"CDK4/6 inhibition in combination with endocrine therapy is the standard of care for estrogen receptor (ER+) breast cancer, and although cytostasis is frequently observed, new treatment strategies that enhance efficacy are required. Here, we perform two independent genome-wide CRISPR screens to identify genetic determinants of CDK4/6 and endocrine therapy sensitivity. Genes involved in oxidative stress and ferroptosis modulate sensitivity, with GPX4 as the top sensitiser in both screens. Depletion or inhibition of GPX4 increases sensitivity to palbociclib and giredestrant, and their combination, in ER+ breast cancer models, with GPX4 null xenografts being highly sensitive to palbociclib. GPX4 perturbation additionally sensitises triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) models to palbociclib. Palbociclib and giredestrant induced oxidative stress and disordered lipid metabolism, leading to a ferroptosis-sensitive state. Lipid peroxidation is promoted by a peroxisome AGPAT3-dependent pathway in ER+ breast cancer models, rather than the classical ACSL4 pathway. Our data demonstrate that CDK4/6 and ER inhibition creates vulnerability to ferroptosis induction, that could be exploited through combination with GPX4 inhibitors, to enhance sensitivity to the current therapies in breast cancer.",
Late-line options for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: a review and evidence-based algorithm,"Paolo Ciracì, Vittorio Studiale, Ada Taravella, Carlotta Antoniotti, Chiara Cremolini",2024-11-18,"Over the past few years, several novel systemic treatments have emerged for patients with treatment-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, thus making selection of the most effective later-line therapy a challenge for medical oncologists. Over the past decade, regorafenib and trifluridine–tipiracil were the only available drugs and often provided limited clinical benefit compared to best supportive care. Results from subsequent practice-changing trials opened several novel therapeutic avenues, both for unselected patients (such as trifluridine–tipiracil plus bevacizumab or fruquintinib) and for subgroups defined by the presence of actionable alterations in their tumours (such as HER2-targeted therapies or KRASG12C inhibitors) or with no acquired mechanisms of resistance to the previously received targeted agents in circulating tumour DNA (such as retreatment with anti-EGFR antibodies). In this Review, we provide a comprehensive overview of advances in the field over the past few years and offer a practical perspective on translation of the most relevant results into the daily management of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer using an evidence-based algorithm. Finally, we discuss some of the most appealing ongoing areas of research and highlight approaches with the potential to further expand the therapeutic armamentarium.",

Impact of renal impairment on early development of severe neutropenia with trifluridine/tipiracil treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer,"Yoshitaka Saito, Yoh Takekuma, Yoshito Komatsu, Mitsuru Sugawara",2024-11-06,"Trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) with or without bevacizumab is an effective treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). As this agent is mainly excreted via the kidney, we aimed to evaluate the impact of renal impairment (RI) on the early development of severe neutropenia, a dose-limiting toxicity and whose development reflects better treatment outcomes, in patients with mCRC treated with FTD/TPI. Patients with mCRC receiving FTD/TPI ± bevacizumab (n = 100) were divided into the RI group (creatinine clearance [CCr] < 90 mL/min) or control group (CCr ≥ 90 mL/min), and retrospectively evaluated. Severe neutropenia during the first two cycles occurred in 57.6% and 34.2% of patients in the RI and control groups, respectively, which was significantly different (P = 0.03) and met our primary endpoint. Furthermore, the incidence during the first cycle also differed significantly (52.5% in the RI group and 17.1% in the control group, P = 0.0004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that baseline RI and neutropenia were significant risk factors for early severe neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 3.07, 1.24–7.59, P = 0.02 for RI, and 9.76, 1.08–88.11, P = 0.04 for neutropenia). In conclusion, our study suggested that patients with RI can exhibit early severe neutropenia during real-world FTD/TPI treatment for mCRC.","Trifluridine/tipiracil, Renal impairment, Severe neutropenia, Bevacizumab, Risk factor"
Detection of IDH mutation in glioma by desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) tandem mass spectrometry,"Mahdiyeh Shahi, Steven Pringle, Michael Morris, Diogo Moniz Garcia, Alfredo Quiñones-Hinojosa, R. Graham Cooks",2024-11-06,"Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) tandem mass spectrometry (MS) is used to assess mutation status of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) in human gliomas. Due to the diffuse nature of gliomas, total gross resection is not normally achieved during surgery, leading to tumor recurrence. The mutation status of IDH has clinical significance due to better prognosis in IDH-mutant patients. The mutant IDH converts alpha-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) into 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which accumulates abnormally in cells. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and genetic testing, the gold standards, are incompatible with intraoperative applications but DESI tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can be used to assess the mutation status of IDH enzyme from tissue intraoperatively. Here, on off-line evaluation is made of the performance of two different types of mass spectrometers in characterization of IDH mutation status. The intensity of 2HG is measured against glutamate (Glu), an intrinsic reference molecule, in both tandem MS measurements. In both cases using DESI clear separation between IDH-mutant (mut) and IDH-wildtype (wt) samples (p < 0.0001) is observed, despite the short analysis time. Due to the higher detection sensitivity, multiple reaction monitoring experiments using a triple quadrupole show slightly better performance compared to product ion MS/MS performed on a simple linear ion trap. Both DESI-MS platforms are capable of providing information on IDH mutation status, which might in future be used at the time of surgery to support decision-making on resection regions, especially at tumor margins.","Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), 2-hydroxyglutarate, Oncometabolite, Molecular diagnostics, Brain cancer, Ambient ionization"
Prostaglandin E2-EP2/EP4 signaling induces immunosuppression in human cancer by impairing bioenergetics and ribosome biogenesis in immune cells,"Siwakorn Punyawatthananukool, Ryuma Matsuura, Thamrong Wongchang, Nao Katsurada, Tatsuaki Tsuruyama, Masaki Tajima, Yutaka Enomoto, Toshio Kitamura, Masahiro Kawashima, Masakazu Toi, Koji Yamanoi, Junzo Hamanishi, Shigeo Hisamori, Kazutaka Obama, Varodom Charoensawan, Dean Thumkeo, Shuh Narumiya",2024-11-01,"While prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is produced in human tumor microenvironment (TME), its role therein remains poorly understood. Here, we examine this issue by comparative single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells infiltrating human cancers and syngeneic tumors in female mice. PGE receptors EP4 and EP2 are expressed in lymphocytes and myeloid cells, and their expression is associated with the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and MYC targets, glycolysis and ribosomal proteins (RPs). Mechanistically, CD8+ T cells express EP4 and EP2 upon TCR activation, and PGE2 blocks IL-2-STAT5 signaling by downregulating Il2ra, which downregulates c-Myc and PGC-1 to decrease OXPHOS, glycolysis, and RPs, impairing migration, expansion, survival, and antitumor activity. Similarly, EP4 and EP2 are induced upon macrophage activation, and PGE2 downregulates c-Myc and OXPHOS in M1-like macrophages. These results suggest that PGE2-EP4/EP2 signaling impairs both adaptive and innate immunity in TME by hampering bioenergetics and ribosome biogenesis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.",
The association between breast cancer and lung cancer: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study,"Xiaoqian Li, Junjie Liu, Jingyi Zhang, Yidi Wang, Jianjun He, Huimin Zhang",2024-11-06,"With increasing life spans, breast cancer (BC) survivors may face the possibility of developing second primary cancer (SPC), which can considerably shorten survival. Lung cancer (LC) is a common SPC among BC survivors. This study explored the association between these two cancers through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. A bidirectional two-sample MR analysis was conducted with BC genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) included 228,951 individuals and the GWAS summary statistics from the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) of LC included 112,781 individuals. The IVW method and MR-RAPS method showed a causal effect of overall BC on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (IVW: OR = 1.060, 95% CI = 1.008–1.116, P = 0.024; MR-RAPS: OR = 1.059, 95% CI = 1.005–1.116, P = 0.033), which indicated that patients with BC had an increased risk of LUAD. However, there is no strong evidence for a causal effect of LUAD on BC. Our study revealed a causal effect of BC on second primary LUAD, suggesting that we should intensify screening for second primary LC in BC survivors. Early intervention and treatment for patients with second primary LC are needed to reduce mortality in BC survivors.","Breast cancer, Lung cancer, Mendelian randomization, Causal effect"
53BP1 loss elicits cGAS-STING-dependent antitumor immunity in ovarian and pancreatic cancer,"Yajie Sun, Jeffrey Patterson-Fortin, Sen Han, Zhe Li, Zuzanna Nowicka, Yuna Hirohashi, Susan Kilgas, Jae Kyo Yi, Alexander Spektor, Wojciech Fendler, Panagiotis A. Konstantinopoulos, Dipanjan Chowdhury",2024-08-06,"53BP1 nucleates the anti-end resection machinery at DNA double-strand breaks, thereby countering BRCA1 activity. Loss of 53BP1 leads to DNA end processing and homologous recombination in BRCA1-deficient cells. Consequently, BRCA1-mutant tumors, typically sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), become resistant in the absence of 53BP1. Here, we demonstrate that the ‘leaky’ DNA end resection in the absence of 53BP1 results in increased micronuclei and cytoplasmic double-stranded DNA, leading to activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and pro-inflammatory signaling. This enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration, activates macrophages and natural killer cells, and impedes tumor growth. Loss of 53BP1 correlates with a response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and improved overall survival. Immunohistochemical assessment of 53BP1 in two malignancies, high grade serous ovarian cancer and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which are refractory to ICBs, reveals that lower 53BP1 levels correlate with an increased adaptive and innate immune response. Finally, BRCA1-deficient tumors that develop resistance to PARPi due to the loss of 53BP1 are susceptible to ICB. Therefore, we conclude that 53BP1 is critical for tumor immunogenicity and underpins the response to ICB. Our results support including 53BP1 expression as an exploratory biomarker in ICB trials for malignancies typically refractory to immunotherapy.",

Patients received nivolumab 360 mg intravenously (iv) on day 1, carboplatin AUC 5 iv on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg/m2/d iv on days 1–3, every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for up to 24 months, disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the 12-month overall survival (OS) rate (H0 50%, H1 72%, β 80%, α 5%). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. From 2019 to 2021, 37 patients were enrolled. The most common primary sites were the pancreas (37.8%), stomach (16.2%) and colon (10.8%). Twenty-five patients (67.6%) were poorly differentiated carcinomas (NECs) and/or had a Ki67 index >55%.

Identifying key circulating tumor DNA parameters for predicting clinical outcomes in metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer after first-line chemoimmunotherapy,"Haolun Ding, Min Yuan, Yaning Yang, Xu Steven Xu",2024-08-10,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) provides valuable tumor-related information without invasive biopsies, yet consensus is lacking on optimal parameters for predicting clinical outcomes. Utilizing longitudinal ctDNA data from the large phase 3 IMpower150 study (NCT02366143) of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab in patients with stage IV non-squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), here we report that post-treatment ctDNA response correlates significantly with radiographic response. However, only modest concordance is identified, revealing that ctDNA response is likely not a surrogate for radiographic response; both provide distinct information. Various ctDNA metrics, especially early ctDNA nadirs, emerge as primary predictors for progression-free survival and overall survival, potentially better assessing long-term benefits for chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC. Integrating radiographic and ctDNA assessments enhances prediction of survival outcomes. We also identify optimal cutoff values for risk stratification and key assessment timepoints, notably Weeks 6–9, for insights into clinical outcomes. Overall, our identified optimal ctDNA parameters can enhance the prediction of clinical outcomes, refine trial designs, and inform therapeutic decisions for first-line NSCLC patients.",

Secondary endpoints demonstrated sustained clinical responses, favorable pharmacokinetic parameters and a 6-month progression-free survival of 82%. Vactosertib combined with pomalidomide was well-tolerated at all dose levels and displayed a manageable adverse event profile. Exploratory analysis indicated that vactosertib co-treatment with pomalidomide also reduced TGFβ levels in patient bone marrow as well as the level of CD8+ T-cells that expressed the immunoinhibitory marker PD-1. In vitro experiments indicated that vactosertib+pomalidomide co-treatment decreased the viability of MM cell lines and patient tumor cells, and increased CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic activity. Vactosertib is a safe therapeutic that demonstrates tumor-intrinsic activity and can overcome immunosuppressive challenges within the tumor microenvironment to reinvigorate T-cell fitness.

A novel small molecule Enpp1 inhibitor improves tumor control following radiation therapy by targeting stromal Enpp1 expression,"Jason R Baird, Alejandro F Alice, Roland Saito, Qingqing Chai, Minhua Han, Cindy Ng, Stephanie Han, Beth Fernandez, Sarah Ledoux, Johannes Grosse, Alan J Korman, Megan Potuznik, Venkatesh Rajamanickam, Brady Bernard, Marka R Crittenden, Michael J Gough",2024-12-02,"The uniqueness in each person’s cancer cells and variation in immune infiltrates means that each tumor represents a unique problem, but therapeutic targets can be found among their shared features. Radiation therapy alters the interaction between the cancer cells and the stroma through release of innate adjuvants. The extranuclear DNA that can result from radiation damage of cells can result in production of the second messenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS). In turn, cGAMP can activate the innate sensor stimulator of interferon genes (STING), resulting in innate immune activation. Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (Enpp1) is a phosphodiesterase that can be expressed by cancer cells that can degrade cGAMP, thus can decrease or block STING activation following radiation therapy, impairing the innate immunity that is critical to support adaptive immune control of tumors. We observed that many human and murine cancer cells lack Enpp1 expression, but that Enpp1 is expressed in cells of the tumor stroma where it limits tumor control by radiation therapy. We demonstrate in preclinical models the efficacy of a novel Enpp1 inhibitor and show that this inhibitor improves tumor control by radiation even where the cancer cells lack Enpp1. This mechanism requires STING and type I interferon (IFN) receptor expression by non-cancer cells and is dependent on CD8 T cells as a final effector mechanism of tumor control. This suggests that Enpp1 inhibition may be an effective partner for radiation therapy regardless of whether cancer cells express Enpp1. This broadens the potential patient base for whom Enpp1 inhibitors can be applied to improve innate immune responses following radiation therapy.",

This non-interventional comparative cohort study compared progression-free survival (PFS) between the MEL-200 and BU/CY in patients with MM treated with PIs and/or IMIDs. A total of 137 patients were analyzed (MEL-200,113 patients; BU/CY, 24 patients). The BU/CY group had a higher rate of PI and/or IMID use and very good partial response (VGPR) or complete remission (CR) at ASCT and post-ASCT maintenance. Median PFS was 29.7 and 46.8 months in the MEL-200 and BU/CY groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, PFS was significantly better in the BU/CY group. International Staging System Stage I and VGPR or CR at ASCT were significantly associated with longer PFS. No treatment-related mortality was observed in either group by day 100.

RNA isolation from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples was performed using the Promega ReliaPrep RNA Miniprep System, facilitating gene amplification relevant to cancer through the Archer® FusionPlexComprehensiveThyroid and Lung (CTL) kit. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) on the Illumina NextSeq platform enabled comprehensive analysis of target areas. Utilizing Archer Analysis software, secondary analyses involving data cleansing, alignment, and variant/fusion identification were executed against the human reference genome hg19 (GRCh37). Expression patterns were visualized using HeatMap graphics. Our findings revealed a notable presence of KRAS gene mutations in approximately 20% of NSCLC patients. Among these mutations, the G12C variant was predominant at 50%, followed by G12V and G12D variants at 11.2% each. Notably, patients harboring the G12C variant responded favorably to sotorasib medication. These results underscore the importance of mutational profiling and targeted therapeutic approaches in managing NSCLC, particularly highlighting the promising efficacy of sotorasib in G12C-mutated cases.","KRAS G12C mutation, Non-small-cell lung cancer, Sotorasib"
Radiomics analysis in differentiating osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma based on T2-weighted imaging and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging,"Zhi Gao, Zhongshang Dai, Zhengxiao Ouyang, Dianqing Li, Sihuai Tang, Penglin Li, Xudong Liu, Yongfang Jiang, Deye Song",2024-11-04,"This study was performed to investigate the diagnostic value of radiomics models constructed by fat suppressed T2-weighted imaging (T2WI-FS) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CET1) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for differentiation of osteosarcoma (OS) and chondrosarcoma (CS). In this retrospective cohort study, we included all inpatients with pathologically confirmed OS or CS from Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (Hunan, China) as of October 2020. Demographic and imaging variables were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between OS and CS group. Totals of 530 radiomics features were extracted from CET1 and T2WI-FS sequences based on MRI. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used for screening and dimensionality reduction of the radiomics model. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to construct the radiomics model, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the radiomics model. The training cohort and validation cohort included 87 and 29 patients, respectively. 8 CET1 features and 15 T2WI-FS features were screened based on the radiomics features. In the training group, the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) value for CET1 and T2WI-FS sequences in the radiomics model was 0.894 (95% CI 0.817–0.970) and 0.970 (95% CI 0.940–0.999), respectively.

Biallelic loss of BCMA as a resistance mechanism to CAR T cell therapy in a patient with multiple myeloma,"Mehmet Kemal Samur, Mariateresa Fulciniti, Anil Aktas Samur, Abdul Hamid Bazarbachi, Yu-Tzu Tai, Rao Prabhala, Alejandro Alonso, Adam S. Sperling, Timothy Campbell, Fabio Petrocca, Kristen Hege, Shari Kaiser, Hervé Avet Loiseau, Kenneth C. Anderson, Nikhil C. Munshi",2021-02-08,"BCMA targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown deep and durable responses in multiple myeloma. However, relapse following therapy is frequently observed, and mechanisms of resistance remain ill-defined. Here, we perform single cell genomic characterization of longitudinal samples from a patient who relapsed after initial CAR T cell treatment with lack of response to retreatment. We report selection, following initial CAR T cell infusion, of a clone with biallelic loss of BCMA acquired by deletion of one allele and a mutation that creates an early stop codon on the second allele. This loss leads to lack of CAR T cell proliferation following the second infusion and is reflected by lack of soluble BCMA in patient serum. Our analysis suggests the need for careful detection of BCMA gene alterations in multiple myeloma cells from relapse following CAR T cell therapy.",
Fn-OMV potentiates ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis triggered by oncolytic HSV-1 to fuel antitumor immunity,"Shuo Wang, An Song, Jun Xie, Yuan-Yuan Wang, Wen-Da Wang, Meng-Jie Zhang, Zhi-Zhong Wu, Qi-Chao Yang, Hao Li, Junjie Zhang, Zhi-Jun Sun",2024-04-30,"Oncolytic viruses (OVs) show promise as a cancer treatment by selectively replicating in tumor cells and promoting antitumor immunity. However, the current immunogenicity induced by OVs for tumor treatment is relatively weak, necessitating a thorough investigation of the mechanisms underlying its induction of antitumor immunity. Here, we show that HSV-1-based OVs (oHSVs) trigger ZBP1-mediated PANoptosis (a unique innate immune inflammatory cell death modality), resulting in augmented antitumor immune effects. Mechanistically, oHSV enhances the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, leading to the accumulation of endogenous Z-RNA and subsequent activation of ZBP1. To further enhance the antitumor potential of oHSV, we conduct a screening and identify Fusobacterium nucleatum outer membrane vesicle (Fn-OMV) that can increase the expression of PANoptosis execution proteins. The combination of Fn-OMV and oHSV demonstrates potent antitumor immunogenicity. Taken together, our study provides a deeper understanding of oHSV-induced antitumor immunity, and demonstrates a promising strategy that combines oHSV with Fn-OMV.",

We applied cancer personalized profiling by deep sequencing (CAPP-Seq) ctDNA analysis to 218 samples from 65 patients receiving chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, including 28 patients receiving consolidation immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Patients with undetectable ctDNA after chemoradiation therapy had excellent outcomes whether or not they received consolidation ICI. Among such patients, one died from consolidation ICI-related pneumonitis, highlighting the potential utility of only treating patients with MRD. In contrast, patients with MRD after chemoradiation therapy who received consolidation ICI had significantly better outcomes than patients who did not receive consolidation ICI. Furthermore, the ctDNA response pattern early during consolidation ICI identified patients responding to consolidation therapy. Our results suggest that consolidation ICI improves outcomes for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with MRD and that ctDNA analysis may facilitate personalization of consolidation therapy.",
Molecular imaging of renal cell carcinomas: ready for prime time,"Qianyun Wu, Hongda Shao, Wei Zhai, Gang Huang, Jianjun Liu, Jeremie Calais, Weijun Wei",2024-11-14,"The clinical diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is constantly evolving. Diagnostic imaging of RCC relying on enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for renal mass characterization and assessment of tumour thrombosis, whereas pathology is the gold standard for establishing diagnosis. However, molecular imaging is rapidly improving the clinical management of RCC, particularly clear-cell RCC. Molecular imaging aids in the non-invasive visualization and characterization of specific biomarkers such as carbonic anhydrase IX and CD70 within the tumours, which help to assess tumour heterogeneity and status. Target-specific molecular imaging of RCCs will substantially improve the diagnostic landscape of RCC and will further facilitate clinical decision-making regarding initial staging and re-staging, monitoring of recurrence and metastasis, patient stratification and selection, and the prediction and evaluation of treatment responses.",
Differences in axillary response and treatment implications in HER2 positive node positive breast cancer during neoadjuvant HER2 targeted dual therapy,"Exian Mou, Juan Ji, Shiwei Liu, Lan Shu, Liqun Zou, Zhuoxuan Li",2024-11-01,"Explore whether the axillary outcomes differ among HER2 positive subgroups receiving standard dual-targeted therapy, aiming to identify subgroups exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to NAT among HER2-positive/node-positive breast cancer patients. HER2 positive female patients with biopsy-proven node-positive disease from April 2020 to May 2023 were included. All patients underwent standard Neoadjuvant HER2-targeted dual therapy and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) at Breast Surgery Center of Sichuan Cancer Hospital. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associate with axillary pathological complete response (ApCR). Statistical analysis and graphing were performed using SPSS 24.0 and GraphPad Prism 9.0 software. This study enrolled 215 HER2 positive patients with a total ApCR rate of 76.7%, which included 49 HER2 2+/FISH + and 166 HER2 3 + cases with approximate ApCR rates of 63.3% and 80.7% (P = 0.011). Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that HER2 3 + disease (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.21–4.88, P = 0.012), Ki-67 ≥ 20% disease (OR = 3.00, 95% CI 1.26–7.13, P = 0.013) and NAC regimen of TCb (OR = 2.71, 95% CI 1.39–5.38, P = 0.004) were more likely to achieve ApCR. Further subgroup analysis revealed that HER2 3 + patients receiving TCb regimen showed the highest ApCR rate of 88% compared to other subgroups. HER2 3 + breast cancer had a higher ApCR rate than HER2 2+/FISH + breast cancer during Neoadjuvant HER2-targeted dual therapy. HER2 positive patients could benefit from NAC regimen of TCb in axillary response.","Breast cancer, HER2, Axillary pathological complete response, Neoadjuvant HER2-targeted dual therapy, TCb"
Long-term outcomes and prognostic factors of metastatic or recurrent pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: a 20-year review in a single institution,"Fumio Ishizaki, Takahiro Taguchi, Masaki Murata, Sayaka Hoshino, Tomotaka Toba, Keisuke Takeda, Masayuki Tasaki, Kazutoshi Yamana, Takashi Kasahara, Tatsuhiko Hoshii, Kenji Obara, Kazuhide Saito, Yoshihiko Tomita",2024-11-02,"Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL) represent a group of rare neuroendocrine tumors known for their potential to metastasize. This study provides a comprehensive retrospective evaluation of 15 patients diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent PPGL at our institution over a two-decade span (2000–2020). Our primary objectives were to delineate the long-term clinical outcomes and pinpoint key prognostic determinants. Median duration from initial PPGL diagnosis to the onset of metastasis or recurrence stood at 5.8 years. Predominant sites for metastasis included the bone, lung, lymph nodes, and peritoneum. A salient finding was that surgical interventions targeting metastatic lesions significantly improved prognosis. Further analysis revealed that a Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal Gland Scaled Score (PASS) exceeding 7 closely associated with unfavorable outcomes. These insights not only underscore the clinical variability of PPGL’s progression but also highlight the pivotal role of surgical management for metastatic or recurrent cases. The value of the PASS score as an informative prognostic tool was evident, suggesting its utility in shaping future therapeutic approaches. Given the intricacies of PPGL, collaborative studies involving larger patient cohorts will be crucial to optimize management strategies and prognostication.",
Risk factors for local recurrence following marginal mandibulectomy in gingival cancer,"Olof Nilsson, Mathias von Beckerath, Johan Knutsson, Anders Magnuson, Fredrik J. Landström, Rusana Bark",2024-11-01,"Surgery is the first line of treatment in gingival cancers of the mandible, and bone resection is necessary in the majority of cases. In the less extensive surgical option, marginal mandibulectomy (MM), the mandibular base is preserved. In contrast, in a segmental mandibulectomy (SM) the mandible is divided and the continuity is not preserved. If MM can be performed with comparable oncological results to SM, it is the preferred method. The aim of the present study was to identify preoperative predictors for local recurrence (LR), to support the selection of candidates for MM. Outcome measures were local recurrence free survival (LRFS) and disease specific survival (DSS). 67 patients treated with MM between 2008 and 2021 were included. Cox regression analyses of LR with hazard ratios and adjustments for postoperative radiotherapy, pathological T-stage (pT) and soft tissue margins were performed. 5-years LRFS was 63% (95% CI 46.9–75.5) and DSS 80.6% (95% CI 64.7–89.9). In conclusion we found that edentulous patients, more advanced pT-stage and positive soft tissue margins had increased risk for LR. Future studies of the correlation between cT and pT would be important to provide more robust preoperative support in the selection between MM and SM.","Marginal mandibulectomy, Gingival cancer, Local recurrence, Gingival neoplasm"
Low-pass whole genome sequencing of circulating tumor cells to evaluate chromosomal instability in triple-negative breast cancer,"Serena Di Cosimo, Marco Silvestri, Cinzia De Marco, Alessia Calzoni, Maria Carmen De Santis, Maria Grazia Carnevale, Carolina Reduzzi, Massimo Cristofanilli, Vera Cappelletti",2024-09-03,"Chromosomal Instability (CIN) is a common and evolving feature in breast cancer. Large-scale Transitions (LSTs), defined as chromosomal breakages leading to gains or losses of at least 10 Mb, have recently emerged as a metric of CIN due to their standardized definition across platforms. Herein, we report the feasibility of using low-pass Whole Genome Sequencing to assess LSTs, copy number alterations (CNAs) and their relationship in individual circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Initial assessment of LSTs in breast cancer cell lines consistently showed wide-ranging values (median 22, range 4–33, mean 21), indicating heterogeneous CIN. Subsequent analysis of CTCs revealed LST values (median 3, range 0–18, mean 5), particularly low during treatment, suggesting temporal changes in CIN levels. CNAs averaged 30 (range 5–49), with loss being predominant. As expected, CTCs with higher LSTs values exhibited increased CNAs. A CNA-based classifier of individual patient-derived CTCs, developed using machine learning, identified genes associated with both DNA proliferation and repair, such as RB1, MYC, and EXO1, as significant predictors of CIN. The model demonstrated a high predictive accuracy with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.89. Overall, these findings suggest that sequencing CTCs holds the potential to facilitate CIN evaluation and provide insights into its dynamic nature over time, with potential implications for monitoring TNBC progression through iterative assessments.","Chromosomal instability, Large-scale transitions, Circulating tumor cells, Triple-negative breast cancer, Copy number alterations"

Clinicopathological features of lacrimal gland biopsy lesions in 582 Chinese patients,"Lvfu He, Weimin He",2024-11-03,"Background This study was conducted to assess the clinicopathological characteristics of biopsy lesions in the lacrimal gland, in response to evolving pathological technologies and the emergence of new diseases. A retrospective review of case notes was conducted for 582 patients with biopsied lacrimal gland lesions at West China Hospital of Sichuan University in China. This study, spanning from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2021, recorded demographics, clinical features, imaging findings, histopathological diagnoses, and recurrence rates. In a cohort of 582 patients, the mean age was 47.5 years, with 318 being female. Bilateral disease was present in 127 patients. Common signs and symptoms included a palpable mass, lid swelling, proptosis, and decreased ocular movements or diplopia. The predominant pathologies identified were inflammation, epithelial tumors, and lymphoproliferative lesions. Patients with inflammation (mean 32.8 months) experienced symptoms for a longer period compared to those with lymphoproliferative lesions (mean 22.2 months) (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53–19.27, P = 0.022). Younger patients tended to have structural lesions (mean 42.5 years) (95%CI 4.74–21.59, P = 0.003), inflammation (mean 42.9 years) (95%CI 0.46–6.57, P<0.001), or epithelial tumors (mean 46.4 years) (95%CI 6.21–12.38, P<0.001), while older patients more frequently had lymphoproliferative lesions (mean 55.7 years). The period from 2016 to 2021 saw a higher diagnosis rate of biopsied lacrimal gland lesions than from 2010 to 2015. During this later period, there was an increase in cases of immunoglobulin G4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD) and malignant epithelial tumors, while lymphoid hyperplasia cases declined. Adenoid cystic carcinoma showed the highest recurrence rate, with lesion extent and Ki-67 index identified as independent risk factors in our study. Inflammation, epithelial tumors, and lymphoproliferative lesions were the three primary causes of lacrimal gland lesions in our study group. Among the inflammatory conditions, IgG4-ROD was the most specific. The incidence of lacrimal gland lesions has risen, particularly for IgG4-ROD. Adenoid cystic carcinoma among the lacrimal gland lesions was prone to recurrence, with the extent of the lesion and Ki-67 index serving as independent risk factors.","Lacrimal gland, Biopsy, Histopathology, Etiologies"
Radiotherapy-triggered reduction of platinum-based chemotherapeutic prodrugs in tumours,"Qunfeng Fu, Shuren Zhang, Siyong Shen, Zhi Gu, Junyi Chen, Dongfan Song, Pengwei Sun, Chunhong Wang, Zhibin Guo, Yunlong Xiao, Yi Qin Gao, Zijian Guo, Zhibo Liu",2024-07-18,"Pt(II) drugs are a widely used chemotherapeutic, yet their side effects can be severe. Here we show that the radiation-induced reduction of Pt(IV) complexes to cytotoxic Pt(II) drugs is rapid, efficient and applicable in water, that it is mediated by hydrated electrons from water radiolysis and that the X-ray-induced release of Pt(II) drugs from an oxaliplatin prodrug in tumours inhibits their growth, as we show with nearly complete tumour regression in mice with subcutaneous human tumour xenografts. The combination of low-dose radiotherapy with a Pt(IV)-based antibody–trastuzumab conjugate led to the tumour-selective release of the chemotherapeutic in mice and to substantial therapeutic benefits. The radiation-induced local reduction of platinum prodrugs in the reductive tumour microenvironment may expand the utility of radiotherapy.",

We initiated a multi-institutional single-arm phase I study (NCT02599454) enrolling twenty patients with the primary endpoint of maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary endpoints of safety and efficacy; and exploratory mechanistic correlatives. Treatment is well tolerated and full dose atezolizumab (1200 mg) is the MTD. Efficacy signals include early responses (after 2 cycles of ICI, before initiation of SABR) in 17% of patients. Biomarkers of functional adaptive immunity, including T cell activation in the tumor and response to ex-vivo stimulation by circulating T cells, are highly predictive of benefit. These results require validation and are being tested in a phase III randomized trial.",
Molecular features and clinical implications of the heterogeneity in Chinese patients with HER2-low breast cancer,"Lei-Jie Dai, Ding Ma, Yu-Zheng Xu, Ming Li, Yu-Wei Li, Yi Xiao, Xi Jin, Song-Yang Wu, Ya-Xin Zhao, Han Wang, Wen-Tao Yang, Yi-Zhou Jiang, Zhi-Ming Shao",2023-08-22,"The molecular heterogeneity and distinct features of HER2-low breast cancers, particularly in the Chinese population, are not well understood, limiting its precise management in the era of antibody‒drug conjugates. To address this issue, we established a cohort of 434 Chinese patients with HER2-low breast cancer (433 female and one male) and integrated genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiling data. In this cohort, HER2-low tumors are more distinguished from HER2-0 tumors in the hormone receptor–negative subgroup. Within HER2-low tumors, significant interpatient heterogeneity also exists in the hormone receptor–negative subgroup: basal-like tumors resemble HER2-0 disease, and non-basal-like HER2-low tumors mimic HER2-positive disease. These non-basal-like HER2-low tumors are enriched in the HER2-enriched subtype and the luminal androgen receptor subtype and feature PIK3CA mutation, FGFR4/PTK6/ERBB4 overexpression and lipid metabolism activation. Among hormone receptor–positive tumors, HER2-low tumors show less loss/deletion in 17q peaks than HER2-0 tumors. In this work, we reveal the heterogeneity of HER2-low breast cancers and emphasize the need for more precise stratification regarding hormone receptor status and molecular subtype.",
Construction and validation of prognostic models for young cervical cancer patients: age stratification based on restricted cubic splines,"Yuan Gong, Feifei  Gou, Qingfeng Qin, Weijie Tian, Wei Zhao, Dan Zi",2024-11-30,"Cervical cancer (CC) ranks as the second highest cause of morbidity and mortality among young women; however, there are currently no age-specific definitions for young cervical cancer or prognostic models tailored to this demographic. Data on CC diagnosed between 2000 and 2019 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Age stratification is based on the relationship between age and cancer-specific mortality, as demonstrated by restricted cubic spline analyses (RCS). Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were employed to identify independent prognostic factors in the young CC group. Two novel nomograms for this population were developed and validated using an external validation cohort obtained from a local hospital database, evaluated with concordance index (C-index) and calibration plots. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to compare the accuracy of the established models against the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system (2018). A total of 27,658 patients from the SEER database were classified into three age groups (<36 years, 36-60 years, >60 years) based on RCS analyses, with 4,990, 16,922, and 5,746 patients in each group, respectively. The independent prognostic factors identified for young CC included stage, tumour size, grade, histologic type, and surgical intervention. The results of the C-index and calibration in both the training and validation sets confirmed that the two nomograms can accurately predict the occurrence and prognosis of young CC patients. The area under the curve (AUC) values indicated that these models demonstrated higher efficacy in predicting overall survival (OS) compared to the FIGO staging system (2018). These models could potentially serve as effective tools for clinicians to estimate the prognosis of young CC patients.",
Cachexia and efficiency of trifluridine/thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor + bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer,"Masatsune Shibutani, Hideki Tanda, Yuki Seki, Shinichiro Kashiwagi, Tsuyoshi Nishiyama, Yasuhiro Fukui, Daiki Imanishi, Hiroaki Kasashima, Tatsunari Fukuoka, Kiyoshi Maeda",2024-10-29,"In later-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), there may be large differences in treatment efficacy depending on cancer cachexia. Recently, the cachexia index (CXI), which was calculated from the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), serum albumin concentration, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, was developed to evaluate cancer cachexia. We retrospectively examined the CXI of 80 patients who were treated with trifluridine/thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (FTD/TPI) + bevacizumab (Bmab) therapy as a later-line treatment for mCRC, and assessed the impact of cancer cachexia on chemotherapeutic efficacy using CXI. Progression-free and overall survival rates were significantly worse in the low CXI group than in the high CXI group, although there were no marked differences in tumor factors, such as the number of metastatic organs or gene mutations, between the two groups. As the cross-sectional area of the iliopsoas muscle was significantly associated with that of the skeletal muscle, the accuracy of the CXI based on the psoas mass index (P-CXI), which is easier to calculate than the SMI, in predicting treatment outcomes was equivalent to that of the CXI based on the SMI (S-CXI). Cancer cachexia is an important factor related to treatment efficacy in later-line treatments, such as FTD/TPI + Bmab therapy.","Colorectal cancer, Cachexia, CXI, FTD/TPI, Bevacizumab"
"The relationship between immune cells and prostate cancer, and the mediating role of metabolites: a Mendelian randomization study","Xipeng Wu, Wenda Zou, Ziwei Liu",2024-10-31,"Research has demonstrated the significant involvement of immune cells in the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the precise causal relationship between immune cells and PCa remains unclear. This study utilized bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal link between immune cells and PCa. Additionally, employed mediation MR design to ascertain the potential mediating role of metabolites in the connection between immune cells and PCa outcomes. Unswitched memory B cell % lymphocyte and CD24 + CD27 + B cell % lymphocyte were positively related to PCa risk, while CD62L − monocyte absolute count and CD62L − monocyte % monocyte were negatively associated with PCa risk. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to validate these results. The mediation MR results indicate that 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoate (CMPF) levels may be an independent risk factor for PCa, while the succinate to acetoacetate ratio (SA ratio) was found to be a mediator for the effect of CD62L − monocyte % monocyte on PCa, with a mediation proportion of 16.6% (mediation percentage: 16.6%, 95%CI − 163% − 196%). The research validates the genetic causality between particular immune cells and PCa, and has emphasized the potential intermediary function of SA ratio. These noteworthy discoveries provide fresh perspectives for the clinical management of PCa.","Immune cells, Prostate cancer, Mendelian randomization, Metabolites, Mediator"

Nine asymptomatic patients treated with a first-in-human, neoantigen DNA vaccine experienced no dose limiting toxicities (primary endpoint, NCT01209871). All patients achieve stable disease or better, with one minor response, and median time to progression of 72+ months. Post-vaccine single-cell transcriptomics reveal dichotomous antitumor responses, with reduced tumor B-cells (tracked by unique B cell receptor) and their survival pathways, but no change in clonal plasma cells. Downregulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules and paradoxical upregulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) by the latter suggest resistance mechanisms. Vaccine therapy activates and expands bone marrow T-cell clonotypes, and functional neoantigen-specific responses (secondary endpoint), but not co-inhibitory pathways or Treg, and reduces protumoral signaling by myeloid cells, suggesting favorable perturbation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Future strategies may require combinations of vaccines with agents targeting plasma cell subpopulations, or blockade of IGF-1 signaling or myeloid cell checkpoints.",
Association of prophylactic low-dose aspirin use with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in cancer patients,"Hui Hu, Wen-jun Chen, Zi-yi Xiong, Lin-fei Luo, Chuang Sun, Jun-ping Xie",2024-10-29,"The long-term use of aspirin for preventing cardiovascular disease has been recommended for decades. However, there is currently uncertainty regarding the long-term effects of aspirin use on the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in cancer patients. The aim of this work was to analyze the connection between the prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin and the risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and carcinoma death in carcinoma patients in the United States. A cohort study was conducted using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2011–2012, 2013–2014, 2015–2016, and 2017–2018) and associated mortality data. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and hazard ratios (HRs) between non-aspirin use and prophylactic low-dose aspirin use and the risk of death were measured via Cox proportional hazard regression models. A total of 1819 participants were included in the present research, of whom 945 were nonaspirin users and 874 were prophylactic aspirin users. Compared with non-aspirin users, prophylactic low-dose aspirin users had a decreased risk of all-cause death (HR = 0.647, 95% CI = 0.489–0.857). There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of cardiovascular death (HR = 0.623, 95% CI = 0.362–1.074) or cancer death (HR = 0.709, 95% CI = 0.410–1.226). Prophylactic use of low-dose aspirin may lower all-cause mortality in individuals with cancer but does not have a substantial effect on cardiovascular risk or cancer-specific mortality in this patient population.","NHANES, Aspirin, Cancer, Mortality"

Tumour-informed sequencing panels to monitor 30 patient-specific variants were designed and 321 liquid biopsies of 87 patients sequenced. Mean sequencing depth after deduplication using UMIs was 6000x and the error rate of UMI-corrected reads was 2.47×10−4. Variant allele fractions correlated with PET/CT MTV (rho=0.69), S100 (rho=0.72), and LDH (rho=0.54). A decrease of allele fractions between T1 and T2 was associated with improved PFS and OS in the palliative cohort (p = 0.008 and p < 0.001). ctDNA was detected in 76.9% of adjuvant patients with relapse (n = 10/13), while all patients without progression (n = 9) remained ctDNA negative.

Tumors were sequenced with OncoPanel, a targeted next-generation DNA sequencing panel. Diagnoses were classified according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3.2). Over 6.5 years, 888 pediatric cancer patients with 95 distinct diagnoses had successful tumor sequencing. Overall, 33% (n = 289/888) of patients had at least 1 variant matching a precision oncology trial protocol, and 14% (41/289) were treated with molecularly targeted therapy. This study highlights opportunities to use genomic data from hospital-based sequencing performed either for research or clinical care to inform ongoing and future precision oncology clinical trials. Furthermore, the study results emphasize the importance of data sharing to define the genomic landscape and targeted treatment opportunities for the large group of rare pediatric cancers we encounter in clinical practice.",
Pan-cancer analysis of the immunological and oncogenic roles of ATAD2 with verification in papillary thyroid carcinoma,"Zhecheng Li, Yaxin Zhao, Peng Huang, Zhaoyi Wu, Dengjie Ouyang, Adolphus Osei Nyarko, Lei Ai, Zhejia Zhang, Shi Chang",2024-09-27,"ATAD2 (ATPase Family AAA Domain-Containing 2) is highly expressed across varies tumor types, yet its common roles in tumor progression and immune interaction remain unclear. We analyzed the expression and alteration profiles of ATAD2, along with its diagnostic and prognostic role in pan-cancer, utilizing TCGA, GTEx, CPTAC, HPA, and cBioPortal databases. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between ATAD2 and immune infiltration utilizing single-cell sequencing data and TCGA database. Additionally, the expression and oncogenic functions of ATAD2 were verified in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) through MTT, wound-healing, transwell, and flow cytometry assays. Our results revealed significant overexpression of ATAD2 in most cancers, strongly associated with poor prognosis. Amplification was the most frequent alteration type of ATAD2, with its mutation correlating with improved overall survival. ATAD2 was positively correlated with multiple inhibitory immune checkpoints and closely associated with the immunosuppressive microenvironment, particularly in PTC. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ATAD2 promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PTC cells by activating the PI3K-AKT pathway and modulating the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint. Collectively, ATAD2 holds promise as a biomarker for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis, as well as a predictor of immunotherapeutic responsiveness and a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of existing anti-tumor immune therapies.","ATAD2, Pan-cancer, Papillary thyroid carcinoma, Therapeutic target, Tumor immune microenvironment"
Glycolysis inhibition induces anti-tumor central memory CD8+T cell differentiation upon combination with microwave ablation therapy,"Xinyu Tang, Xinrui Mao, Peiwen Ling, Muxin Yu, Hua Pan, Jiaming Wang, Mingduo Liu, Hong Pan, Wen Qiu, Nan Che, Kai Zhang, Feifan Bao, Hongwei Peng, Qiang Ding, Shui Wang, Wenbin Zhou",2024-05-31,"Minimally invasive thermal therapy is a successful alternative treatment to surgery in solid tumors with high complete ablation rates, however, tumor recurrence remains a concern. Central memory CD8+ T cells (TCM) play important roles in protection from chronic infection and cancer. Here we find, by single-cell RNA analysis of human breast cancer samples, that although the memory phenotype of peripheral CD8+ T cells increases slightly after microwave ablation (MWA), the metabolism of peripheral CD8+ T cells remains unfavorable for memory phenotype. In mouse models, glycolysis inhibition by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) in combination with MWA results in long-term anti-tumor effect via enhancing differentiation of tumor-specific CD44hiCD62L+CD8+ TCM cells. Enhancement of CD8+ TCM cell differentiation determined by Stat-1, is dependent on the tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) but takes place in peripheral blood, with metabolic remodeling of CD8+ T cells lasting the entire course of the the combination therapy. Importantly, in-vitro glycolysis inhibition in peripheral CD8+ T cells of patients with breast or liver tumors having been treated with MWA thrice leads to their differentiation into CD8+ TCM cells. Our work thus offers a potential strategy to avoid tumor recurrence following MWA therapy and lays down the proof-of-principle for future clinical trials.",
Circulating thrombospondin 2 as a predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B patients undergoing nucleos(t)ide analog therapy,"Taiki Okumura, Takefumi Kimura, Yuki Ichikawa, Takanobu Iwadare, Shun-ichi Wakabayashi, Hiroyuki Kobayashi, Yuki Yamashita, Takuro Uchida, Sai P. Pydi, Naoki Tanaka, Takeji Umemura",2024-10-26,"Thrombospondin 2 (TSP2) plays a vital role in collagen/fibrin formation, bone growth, vascular density regulation, hemostasis, and cell adhesion. Close associations of serum TSP2 with histological severity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic hepatitis C were reported. The present study investigated the significance of circulating TSP2 in chronic hepatitis B patients. Eighty-seven biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis B patients were analyzed in cross-sectional Study 1 to search for correlations between serum TSP2 levels prior to liver biopsy and clinicopathological parameters. In longitudinal Study 2, 51 chronic hepatitis B patients with long-term follow-up (mean: 7.5 years) were examined for changes in serum TSP2 levels during nucleos(t)ide analog (NA) therapy along with trends in hepatocarciongenesis. In Study 1, serum TSP2 levels were not significantly associated with portal inflammation or fibrosis. Study 2 revealed that serum TSP2 was significantly decreased after 48 weeks of NA therapy (P < 0.001). Notably, TSP2 levels at 48 weeks of NA administration (TSP2-48W) were significantly higher in the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (+) group than in the HCC (−) group (P = 0.043). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that higher TSP2-48W (≥ 24 ng/mL) was associated with future HCC development (P = 0.030). Serum TSP2 levels may be a potential predictor of HCC development in hepatitis B patients receiving NA therapy. Longitudinal prospective studies are necessary to validate our findings.","Hepatitis B, Nucleos(t)ide analog, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Thrombospondin 2, Biomarker"
Articulation in postoperative patients treated for early- and advanced-stage tongue cancer,"Chun-Hsien Ho, Ching-Nung Wu, Chi-Chih Lai, Pei-Chun Huang, Hsin-Chen Li",2024-10-27,"Tongue cancer is among the most prevalent head and neck cancers and is most commonly treated via surgery. We assessed the articulation differences in patients with early and advanced tongue cancer. The study included 26 postoperative tongue cancer patients. We evaluated articulation based on bilabial, labiodental, apical, posterior, laminal, apical front, and apical back speech sounds. The 26 postoperative tongue cancer patients (24 males, two females) had an average age of 54.3 (range 37–89 old) years. Twelve patients were classified as early T stage (T1/T2), while 14 were classified as advanced T stage (T3/T4). The total articulation score was not significantly related to the T stage but apical sounds were so associated. The total articulation score did not significantly differ between postoperative patients with early and advanced tongue cancer. In subgroup analysis, the apical sound was significantly impaired in postoperative patients with advanced tongue cancer.","Articulation, Tongue cancer, Tumor stage, T stage"
Development of folate receptor targeting chimeras for cancer selective degradation of extracellular proteins,"Yaxian Zhou, Chunrong Li, Xuankun Chen, Yuan Zhao, Yaxian Liao, Penghsuan Huang, Wenxin Wu, Nicholas S. Nieto, Lingjun Li, Weiping Tang",2024-10-08,"Targeted protein degradation has emerged as a novel therapeutic modality to treat human diseases by utilizing the cell’s own disposal systems to remove protein target. Significant clinical benefits have been observed for degrading many intracellular proteins. Recently, the degradation of extracellular proteins in the lysosome has been developed. However, there have been limited successes in selectively degrading protein targets in disease-relevant cells or tissues, which would greatly enhance the development of precision medicine. Additionally, most degraders are not readily available due to their complexity. We report a class of easily accessible Folate Receptor TArgeting Chimeras (FRTACs) to recruit the folate receptor, primarily expressed on malignant cells, to degrade extracellular soluble and membrane cancer-related proteins in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that FRTAC is a general platform for developing more precise and effective chemical probes and therapeutics for the study and treatment of cancers.",

Post-pubertal (type II) malignant GCTs may present as seminoma, non-seminoma or mixed histologies. In contrast, pre-pubertal (type I) GCTs are limited to (benign) teratoma and (malignant) yolk sac tumor (YST). Epidemiologic and molecular data have shown that pre- and post-pubertal GCTs arise by distinct mechanisms. Dedicated studies of the genomic landscape of type I and II GCT in children and adolescents are lacking. Here we present an integrated genomic analysis of extracranial GCTs across the age spectrum from 0–24 years. Activation of the WNT pathway by somatic mutation, copy-number alteration, and differential promoter methylation is a prominent feature of GCTs in children, adolescents and young adults, and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Significantly, we find that small molecule WNT inhibitors can suppress GCT cells both in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight the importance of WNT pathway signaling in GCTs across all ages and provide a foundation for future efforts to develop targeted therapies for these cancers.",

The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR), with ≥5/22 overall considered of interest. Secondary outcomes were safety, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression free survival and overall survival. Translational research was an exploratory outcome. Potential biomarkers were evaluated in archival tissue by immunohistochemistry and next generation sequencing panel. In C1, 25 patients were enrolled, and CBR was 20% (95% CI: 9–39) with median clinical benefit duration of 5.3 months. The ORR was 4% (95% CI: 0–20). In C2, 22 patients were enrolled, and the CBR was 31.8% (95% CI: 16–53) with median clinical benefit duration of 6.8 months. The ORR was 14% (95% CI: 3–35). No new safety signals were detected. No significant association was detected between clinical benefit and IHC markers (PTEN, p53, MMR, PD-L1), or molecular profiling (PTEN, TP53, homologous recombination repair genes). In conclusion, niraparib monotherapy did not meet the efficacy threshold. Niraparib in combination with dostarlimab showed modest activity.",

Among the 172 AML patients analysed, 48.3% (n = 83) were females. Median age was 31.5 years (range 14 to 62 years), two patients was more than 60 years old (1.2%). Median follow-up was 44 months (range 1 to 94 months). According to the AML-DRG model, 109, 49 and 14 patients were in low-, intermediate- and high-risk group, respectively. According to the AML-HCT-CR model, 108, 30, 20 and 14 patients were in low-, intermediate-, high- and very high-risk group, respectively. Our results showed that the AML-DRG and AML-HCT-CR models significantly predicted cumulative incidence of relapse (p < 0.001; p < 0.001). But AML-DRG model was not associated with NRM (p = 0.072). Univariate analysis showed that the AML-DRG model could better stratify AML patients into different risk groups compared to the AML-HCT-CR model. Multivariate analysis confirmed that prognostic impact of AML-DRG and AML-HCT-CR models on post-transplant OS was independent to age, sex, conditioning type, transplant modality, and stem cell source (p < 0.001; p < 0.001). AML-DRG and AML-HCT-CR models can be used to effectively predict post-transplant survival in patients with AML receiving AHCT. Compared to AML-HCT-CR score, the AML-DRG score allows better stratification and improved survival prediction of AML patients post-transplant.",

The exploratory analyses of EC-CRT-001 include exploring the role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and blood-based tumor mutational burden (bTMB) in predicting the response and survival. In total, 118 blood and 35 tissue samples from 42 enrolled patients were included in the analyses. We found that ctDNA-negative patients achieved a higher cCR compared to those with detectable ctDNA during CRT (83%, 19/23 vs. 39%, 7/18; p = 0.008) or post-CRT (78%, 21/27 vs. 30%, 3/10; p = 0.017).

Malek, Antti Poso, Michael Bitzer",2024-02-12,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)−2 can be inhibited by FGFR-selective or non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Selective TKIs are approved for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) with FGFR2 fusions; however, their application is limited by a characteristic pattern of adverse events or evocation of kinase domain mutations. A comprehensive characterization of a patient cohort treated with the non-selective TKI lenvatinib reveals promising efficacy in FGFR2-driven CCA. In a bed-to-bench approach, we investigate FGFR2 fusion proteins bearing critical tumor-relevant point mutations. These mutations confer growth advantage of tumor cells and increased resistance to selective TKIs but remain intriguingly sensitive to lenvatinib. In line with clinical observations, in-silico analyses reveal a more favorable interaction pattern of lenvatinib with FGFR2, including an increased flexibility and ligand efficacy, compared to FGFR-selective TKIs. Finally, the treatment of a patient with progressive disease and a newly developed kinase mutation during therapy with a selective inhibitor results in a striking response to lenvatinib. Our in vitro, in silico, and clinical data suggest that lenvatinib is a promising treatment option for FGFR2-driven CCA, especially when insurmountable adverse reactions of selective TKIs or acquired kinase mutations occur.",
Tumor histoculture captures the dynamic interactions between tumor and immune components in response to anti-PD1 in head and neck cancer,"Nandini Pal Basak, Kowshik Jaganathan, Biswajit Das, Oliyarasi Muthusamy, Rajashekar M, Ritu Malhotra, Amit Samal, Moumita Nath, Ganesh MS, Amritha Prabha Shankar, Prakash BV, Vijay Pillai, Manjula BV, Jayaprakash C, Vasanth K, Gowri Shankar K, Sindhu Govindan, Syamkumar V, Juby, Koushika R, Chandan Bhowal, Upendra Kumar, Govindaraj K, Mohit Malhotra, Satish Sankaran",2024-02-21,"Dynamic interactions within the tumor micro-environment drive patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Existing preclinical models lack true representation of this complexity. Using a Head and Neck cancer patient derived TruTumor histoculture platform, the response spectrum of 70 patients to anti-PD1 treatment is investigated in this study. With a subset of 55 patient samples, multiple assays to characterize T-cell reinvigoration and tumor cytotoxicity are performed. Based on levels of these two response parameters, patients are stratified into five sub-cohorts, with the best responder and non-responder sub-cohorts falling at extreme ends of the spectrum. The responder sub-cohort exhibits high T-cell reinvigoration, high tumor cytotoxicity with T-cells homing into the tumor upon treatment whereas immune suppression and tumor progression pathways are pre-dominant in the non-responders. Some moderate responders benefit from combination of anti-CTLA4 with anti-PD1, which is evident from better cytotoxic T-cell: T-regulatory cell ratio and enhancement of tumor cytotoxicity. Baseline and on-treatment gene expression signatures from this study stratify responders and non-responders in unrelated clinical datasets.",

This study examined these temporal changes in therapy with long-term outcomes in adult survivors of childhood glioma. Among 2,501 5-year survivors of glioma in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study diagnosed 1970–1999, exposure to radiation decreased over time. Survivors from more recent eras were at lower risk of late mortality (≥5 years from diagnosis), severe/disabling/life-threatening chronic health conditions (CHCs) and subsequent neoplasms (SNs). Adjusting for treatment exposure (surgery only, chemotherapy, or any cranial radiation) attenuated this risk (for example, CHCs (1990s versus 1970s), relative risk (95% confidence interval), 0.63 (0.49–0.80) without adjustment versus 0.93 (0.72–1.20) with adjustment). Compared to surgery alone, radiation was associated with greater than four times the risk of late mortality, CHCs and SNs. Evolving therapy, particularly avoidance of cranial radiation, has improved late outcomes for childhood glioma survivors without increased risk for late recurrence.",

A total of 1757 patients with Grade III-IV non-metastatic UC were analyzed. Overall survival (OS) was assessed through Kaplan–Meier analysis, and independent prognostic factors were identified via Cox regression. A Nomogram model was developed and evaluated using the concordance index, area under the time-dependent ROC curve, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 82.8%, 55.6%, and 42.8%, respectively. Age, treatment protocol, T stage, and N stage were significant prognostic factors. Both SU + chemotherapy and radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) + chemotherapy demonstrated comparable survival outcomes, outperforming surgery alone, particularly in patients aged 70 and older. The Nomogram demonstrated high predictive accuracy and clinical utility. These findings suggest that SU + chemotherapy offers survival benefits similar to RNU + chemotherapy, making it a viable option, especially for elderly patients or those with impaired renal function.","Ureteral cancer, Segmental ureterectomy, Nomogram, Prognostic anaylsis"

In this study, high-depth targeted sequencing of peripheral blood from 76 NDMM patients revealed CHIP in 46% of them, with a variant allele frequency (VAF) ranging from ~ 1 to 34%. The most frequently mutated gene was DNMT3A, followed by TET2. More aggressive disease features were observed among CHIP carriers, who also exhibited higher proportion of high-risk stages (ISS and R-ISS 3) compared to controls. Longitudinal analyses at diagnosis and during follow-up showed a slight increase of VAFs (p = 0.058) for epigenetic (DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1) and DNA repair genes (TP53; p = 0.0123). A more stable frequency was observed among other genes, suggesting different temporal dynamics of CH clones. Adverse clinical outcomes, in term of overall and progression-free survivals, were observed in CHIP carriers. These patients also exhibited weakened immune T-cells and enhanced frailty, predicting greater toxicity and consequently shorter event-free survival. Finally, correlation analysis identified platelets count as biomarker for higher VAF among CHIP carriers, regardless of the specific variant. Overall, our study highlights specific biological and clinical features, paving the way for the development of tailored strategies for MM patients carrying CHIP.","Multiple myeloma, Biomarkers, CHIP, Toxicity, Frailty"

Moderate to severe radiation dermatitis occurs in most human radiation patients, causing pain, aesthetic distress, and a negative impact on tumor control. No effective prevention or treatment for radiation dermatitis exists. The lack of well-characterized, clinically relevant animal models of human radiation dermatitis contributes to the absence of strategies to mitigate radiation dermatitis. Here, we establish and characterize a hairless SKH-1 mouse model of human radiation dermatitis by correlating temporal stages of clinical and pathological skin injury. We demonstrate that a single ionizing radiation treatment of 30 Gy using 6 MeV electrons induces severe clinical grade 3 peak toxicity at 12 days, defined by marked erythema, desquamation and partial ulceration, with resolution occurring by 25 days. Histopathology reveals that radiation-induced skin injury features temporally unique inflammatory changes. Upregulation of epidermal and dermal TGF-ß1 and COX-2 protein expression occurs at peak dermatitis, with sustained epidermal TGF-ß1 expression beyond resolution. Specific histopathological variables that remain substantially high at peak toxicity and early clinical resolution, including epidermal thickening, hyperkeratosis and dermal fibroplasia/fibrosis, serve as specific measurable parameters for in vivo interventional preclinical studies that seek to mitigate radiation-induced skin injury.","Translational, Dermatitis, Radiation, Skin, Inflammation, TGF-ß1"

Human and murine PTCL-NOSSMARCB1- show similar DNA methylation profiles, with hypermethylation of T-cell-related genes and hypomethylation of genes involved in myeloid development. Single-cell analyses of human and murine tumors revealed a rich and complex network of interactions between tumor cells and an immunosuppressive and exhausted tumor microenvironment (TME).

An immunosuppressive TIME containing elevated tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and scarce CD8+ T cells is associated with poor outcome, but the regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that ETS1-driven caspase-1 expression, required for IL1β processing and TAM recruitment, is negatively regulated by estrogen receptors alpha (ERα) and a defining feature of TNBC. Elevated tumoral caspase-1 is associated with a distinct TIME characterized by increased pro-tumoral TAMs and CD8+ T cell exclusion from tumor nests. Mouse models prove the functional importance of ERα, ETS1, caspase-1 and IL1β in TIME conformation. Caspase-1 inhibition induces an immunoreactive TIME and reverses resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, identifying a therapeutically targetable mechanism that governs TNBC spatial organization.",
Tumor draining lymph nodes connected to cold triple-negative breast cancers are characterized by Th2-associated microenvironment,"Weihua Guo, Jiayi Tan, Lei Wang, Colt A. Egelston, Diana L.

Here we directly compare tumor-free TDLNs draining “cold” and “hot” human triple negative breast cancers (TDLNCold and TDLNHot). Using machine-learning-based self-correlation analysis of immune gene expression, we find unbalanced intranodal regulations within TDLNCold. Two gene pairs (TBX21/GATA3-CXCR1) with opposite correlations suggest preferential priming of T helper 2 (Th2) cells by mature dendritic cells (DC) within TDLNCold. This is validated by multiplex immunofluorescent staining, identifying more mature-DC-Th2 spatial clusters within TDLNCold versus TDLNHot. Associated with this Th2 priming preference, more IL4 producing mast cells (MC) are found within sinus regions of TDLNCold. Downstream, Th2-associated fibrotic TME is found in paired cold tumors with increased Th2/T-helper-1-cell (Th1) ratio, upregulated fibrosis growth factors, and stromal enrichment of cancer associated fibroblasts.

Our results reveal a potential role of IL4+ MCs within TDLNs, associated with Th2 polarization and reduced immune infiltration into tumors.",
Camrelizumab-based induction chemoimmunotherapy in locally advanced stage hypopharyngeal carcinoma: phase II clinical trial,"Hongli Gong, Shu Tian, Hao Ding, Lei Tao, Li Wang, Jie Wang, Tian Wang, Xiaohui Yuan, Yu Heng, Ming Zhang, Yong Shi, Chengzhi Xu, Chunping Wu, Shengzi Wang, Liang Zhou",2024-06-19,"This phase II trial aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of induction chemoimmunotherapy of camrelizumab plus modified TPF in locally advanced hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LA HSCC) (NCT04156698). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints were 3-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), larynx preservation rate (LPR), and metastasis-free survival (MFS). Patients (cT3-4aN0-2M0), regardless of sex, received induction chemoimmunotherapy for three cycles: camrelizumab 200 mg d1, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 d1, cisplatin 25 mg/m2 d1-3, and capecitabine 800 mg/m2 bid d1-14, q21d. Patients were assigned to radioimmunotherapy if they had a complete or partial response, those with stable or progressive disease underwent surgery and adjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy. Camrelizumab was maintained post-radioimmunotherapy. Fifty-one patients were enrolled with a median follow-up duration of 23.7 months. After induction therapy, the ORR was 82.4% (42/51), meeting the prespecified endpoint. Grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in 26 patients, and no treatment-related death occurred. As three-year outcomes were immature, two-year OS, PFS and LPR were reported. As no distant metastatic event had occurred, MFS was not reported here. The two-year OS, PFS, and LPR rates were 83.0%, 77.1%, and 70.0%, respectively. The induction chemoimmunotherapy of camrelizumab plus TPF showed a high ORR rate with an acceptable safety profile in LA HSCC.",

Rossi, Jonathan M. Hernandez, Jeremy L. Davis, Brian A. Coakley, Andrew M. Blakely",2022-04-06,"Wild-type KIT and PDGFRA gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are rare tumors with limited treatment options. We sought to determine the clinicopathologic features of wild-type GIST and identify factors that influence overall survival (OS) using a large national database. Retrospective evaluation of patients with wild-type GIST in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) was performed. Demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment data were analyzed. Features associated with OS were investigated using Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model. 244 patients with median diagnosis age of 59 years (95% CI 57–63) were identified. The stomach was the most common primary site (57%) followed by the small intestine (35%). Surgical resection was performed on 85% of patients and 53% of patients received systemic therapy. Factors associated with decreased OS on multivariable analysis included small intestine primary (HR 2.72, 95% CI 1.13–6.69, P = 0.026) and > 5 mitoses per 50 HPF (HR 4.77, 95% CI 1.86–13.2, P = 0.001). Wild-type GISTs may be identified in older patients, with most arising in the stomach and small bowel. Surgery remains the principal treatment modality. Small intestine primary site and high mitotic count were associated with abbreviated OS.",
Nuclear to cytoplasmic transport is a druggable dependency in MYC-driven hepatocellular carcinoma,"Anja Deutzmann, Delaney K. Sullivan, Renumathy Dhanasekaran, Wei Li, Xinyu Chen, Ling Tong, Wadie D. Mahauad-Fernandez, John Bell, Adriane Mosley, Angela N. Koehler, Yulin Li, Dean W. Felsher",2024-02-01,"The MYC oncogene is often dysregulated in human cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MYC is considered undruggable to date. Here, we comprehensively identify genes essential for survival of MYChigh but not MYClow cells by a CRISPR/Cas9 genome-wide screen in a MYC-conditional HCC model. Our screen uncovers novel MYC synthetic lethal (MYC-SL) interactions and identifies most MYC-SL genes described previously. In particular, the screen reveals nucleocytoplasmic transport to be a MYC-SL interaction. We show that the majority of MYC-SL nucleocytoplasmic transport genes are upregulated in MYChigh murine HCC and are associated with poor survival in HCC patients. Inhibiting Exportin-1 (XPO1) in vivo induces marked tumor regression in an autochthonous MYC-transgenic HCC model and inhibits tumor growth in HCC patient-derived xenografts. XPO1 expression is associated with poor prognosis only in HCC patients with high MYC activity. We infer that MYC may generally regulate and require altered expression of nucleocytoplasmic transport genes for tumorigenesis.",

However, the performance and survival benefits of annual screening have not been evaluated through multicenter prospective studies in a Chinese population. Between 2017 and 2021, we included 14,426 participants with hepatitis B surface antigen seropositivity in an annual HCC screening study in China using a multicenter prospective design with ultrasonography and serum alpha-fetoprotein. After four rounds of screening and follow-up, the adjusted hazard ratios of death after correction for lead-time and length-time biases for screen-detected cancers at the prevalent and incident rounds were 0.74 (95% confidence interval = 0.60–0.91) and 0.52 (95% confidence interval = 0.40–0.68), respectively. A meta-analysis demonstrated that HCC screening was associated with improved survival after adjusting for lead-time bias. Our findings highlight the ‘real-world’ feasibility and effectiveness of annual HCC screening in community settings for the early detection of HCC and to improve survival.",
The neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide shapes an immunosuppressive microenvironment in medullary thyroid cancer,"Yingtong Hou, Bo Lin, Tianyi Xu, Juan Jiang, Shuli Luo, Wanna Chen, Xinwen Chen, Yuanqi Wang, Guanrui Liao, Jianping Wang, Jiayuan Zhang, Xuyang Li, Xiao Xiang, Yubin Xie, Ji Wang, Sui Peng, Weiming Lv, Yihao Liu, Haipeng Xiao",2024-07-19,"Neurotransmitters are key modulators in neuro-immune circuits and have been linked to tumor progression. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor, expresses neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), is insensitive to chemo- and radiotherapies, and the effectiveness of immunotherapies remains unknown. Thus, a comprehensive analysis of the tumor microenvironment would facilitate effective therapies and provide evidence on CGRP’s function outside the nervous system. Here, we compare the single-cell landscape of MTC and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and find that expression of CGRP in MTC is associated with dendritic cell (DC) abnormal development characterized by activation of cAMP related pathways and high levels of Kruppel Like Factor 2 (KLF2), correlated with an impaired activity of tumor infiltrating T cells. A CGRP receptor antagonist could offset CGRP detrimental impact on DC development in vitro. Our study provides insights of the MTC immunosuppressive microenvironment, and proposes CGRP receptor as a potential therapeutic target.",

To address this shortcoming, we perform multi-region sequencing on paired random bone marrow and focal lesion samples from 17 newly diagnosed patients. Using single-cell RNA- and ATAC-seq we find a median of 6 tumor subclones per patient and unique subclones in focal lesions. Genetically identical subclones display different levels of spatial transcriptional plasticity, including nearly identical profiles and pronounced heterogeneity at different sites, which can include differential expression of immunotherapy targets, such as CD20 and CD38. Macrophages are significantly depleted in the microenvironment of focal lesions. We observe proportional changes in the T-cell repertoire but no site-specific expansion of T-cell clones in intramedullary lesions. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the relevance of considering spatial heterogeneity in multiple myeloma with potential implications for models of cell-cell interactions and disease progression.",
Deep mutual learning on hybrid amino acid PET predicts H3K27M mutations in midline gliomas,"Yifan Yuan, Guanglei Li, Shuhao Mei, Mingtao Hu, Ying-Hua Chu, Yi-Cheng Hsu, Chaolin Li, Jianping Song, Jie Hu, Danyang Feng, Fang Xie, Yihui Guan, Qi Yue, Mianxin Liu, Ying Mao",2024-11-25,"Predicting H3K27M mutation status in midline gliomas non-invasively is of considerable interest, particularly using deep learning with 11C-methionine (MET) and 18F-fluoroethyltyrosine (FET) positron emission tomography (PET). To optimise prediction efficiency, we derived an assistance training (AT) scheme to allow mutual benefits between MET and FET learning to boost the predictability but still only require either PET as inputs for predictions. Our method significantly surpassed conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), radiomics-based, and MR-based methods, achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9343 for MET, and an AUC of 0.8619 for FET during internal cross-validation (n = 90). The performance remained high in hold-out testing (n = 19) and consecutive testing cohorts (n = 21), with AUCs of 0.9205 and 0.7404. The clinical feasibility of the proposed method was confirmed by the agreements to multi-departmental decisions and outcomes in pathology-uncertain cases.

However, the identities and traits of these cells, and the potential for improving cancer therapy through their targeting, remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify a senescent subset within previously-defined cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) and in premalignant lesions in mice and humans. Senescent CAFs isolated from mouse and humans expressed elevated levels of immune-regulatory genes. Depletion of senescent CAFs, either genetically or using the Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-199 (venetoclax), increased the proportion of activated CD8+ T cells in mouse pancreatic carcinomas, whereas induction of CAF senescence had the opposite effect. Combining ABT-199 with an immune checkpoint therapy regimen significantly reduced mouse tumor burden. These results indicate that senescent CAFs in PDAC stroma limit the numbers of activated cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and suggest that their targeted elimination through senolytic treatment may enhance immunotherapy.",
Minimal residual disease as a target for liquid biopsy in patients with solid tumours,"Klaus Pantel, Catherine Alix-Panabières",2024-11-28,"Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death in patients with solid tumours. Current imaging technologies are not sufficiently sensitive to detect minimal residual disease (MRD; also known as measurable or molecular residual disease) after initial surgery or chemotherapy, pointing to the need for more sensitive tests to detect remaining traces of cancer in the body. Liquid biopsy, or the analysis of tumour-derived or tumour-induced cells or cellular products in the blood or other body fluids, has opened a new diagnostic avenue to detect and monitor MRD. Liquid biopsy is already used in clinical decision making for patients with haematological malignancies. Here, we review current knowledge on the use of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) to detect and monitor MRD in patients with solid tumours. We also discuss how ctDNA-guided MRD detection and characterization could herald a new era of novel ‘post-adjuvant therapies’ with the potential to eliminate MRD and cure patients before terminal metastatic disease is evident on imaging.",
Prohibitin 2 orchestrates long noncoding RNA and gene transcription to accelerate tumorigenesis,"Tianyi Ding, Haowen Xu, Xiaoyu Zhang, Fan Yang, Jixing Zhang, Yibing Shi, Yiran Bai, Jiaqi Yang, Chaoqun Chen, Chengbo Zhu, He Zhang",2024-09-27,"The spatial co-presence of aberrant long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and abnormal coding genes contributes to malignancy development in various tumors. However, precise coordinated mechanisms underlying this phenomenon in tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that Prohibitin 2 (PHB2) orchestrates the transcription of an oncogenic CASC15-New-Isoform 2 (CANT2) lncRNA and the coding tumor-suppressor gene CCBE1, thereby accelerating melanoma tumorigenesis. In melanoma cells, PHB2 initially accesses the open chromatin sites at the CANT2 promoter, recruiting MLL2 to augment H3K4 trimethylation and activate CANT2 transcription. Intriguingly, PHB2 further binds the activated CANT2 transcript, targeting the promoter of the tumor-suppressor gene CCBE1. This interaction recruits histone deacetylase HDAC1 to decrease H3K27 acetylation at the CCBE1 promoter and inhibit its transcription, significantly promoting tumor cell growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Our study elucidates a PHB2-mediated mechanism that orchestrates the aberrant transcription of lncRNAs and coding genes, providing an intriguing epigenetic regulatory model in tumorigenesis.",

While cervical lymph node metastases (cLNM) are well-recognized in pediatric PTC, the PTC metastatic process and potential radiation association are poorly understood. Here, we analyze cLNM occurrence among 428 PTC with genomic landscape analyses and known drivers (131I-exposed = 349, unexposed = 79; mean age = 27.9 years). We show that cLNM are more frequent in PTC with fusion (55%) versus mutation (30%) drivers, although the proportion varies by specific driver gene (RET-fusion = 71%, BRAF-mutation = 38%, RAS-mutation = 5%). cLNM frequency is not associated with other characteristics, including radiation dose. cLNM molecular profiling (N = 47) demonstrates 100% driver concordance with matched primary PTCs and highly concordant mutational spectra. Transcriptome analysis reveals 17 differentially expressed genes, particularly in the HOXC cluster and BRINP3; the strongest differentially expressed microRNA also is near HOXC10. Our findings underscore the critical role of driver alterations and provide promising candidates for elucidating the biological underpinnings of PTC cLNM.",
The RNF214-TEAD-YAP signaling axis promotes hepatocellular carcinoma progression via TEAD ubiquitylation,"Mengjia Lin, Xiaoyun Zheng, Jianing Yan, Fei Huang, Yilin Chen, Ran Ding, Jinkai Wan, Lei Zhang, Chenliang Wang, Jinchang Pan, Xiaolei Cao, Kaiyi Fu, Yan Lou, Xin-Hua Feng, Junfang Ji, Bin Zhao, Fei Lan, Li Shen, Xianglei He, Yunqing Qiu, Jianping Jin",2024-06-11,"RNF214 is an understudied ubiquitin ligase with little knowledge of its biological functions or protein substrates. Here we show that the TEAD transcription factors in the Hippo pathway are substrates of RNF214. RNF214 induces non-proteolytic ubiquitylation at a conserved lysine residue of TEADs, enhances interactions between TEADs and YAP, and promotes transactivation of the downstream genes of the Hippo signaling. Moreover, YAP and TAZ could bind polyubiquitin chains, implying the underlying mechanisms by which RNF214 regulates the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, RNF214 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and inversely correlates with differentiation status and patient survival. Consistently, RNF214 promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and HCC tumorigenesis in mice. Collectively, our data reveal RNF214 as a critical component in the Hippo pathway by forming a signaling axis of RNF214-TEAD-YAP and suggest that RNF214 is an oncogene of HCC and could be a potential drug target of HCC therapy.",
PPIA dictates NRF2 stability to promote lung cancer progression,"Weiqiang Lu, Jiayan Cui, Wanyan Wang, Qian Hu, Yun Xue, Xi Liu, Ting Gong, Yiping Lu, Hui Ma, Xinyu Yang, Bo Feng, Qi Wang, Naixia Zhang, Yechun Xu, Mingyao Liu, Ruth Nussinov, Feixiong Cheng, Hongbin Ji, Jin Huang",2024-06-03,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) hyperactivation has been established as an oncogenic driver in a variety of human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, despite massive efforts, no specific therapy is currently available to target NRF2 hyperactivation. Here, we identify peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA) is required for NRF2 protein stability. Ablation of PPIA promotes NRF2 protein degradation and blocks NRF2-driven growth in NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, PPIA physically binds to NRF2 and blocks the access of ubiquitin/Kelch Like ECH Associated Protein 1 (KEAP1) to NRF2, thus preventing ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Our X-ray co-crystal structure reveals that PPIA directly interacts with a NRF2 interdomain linker via a trans-proline 174-harboring hydrophobic sequence. We further demonstrate that an FDA-approved drug, cyclosporin A (CsA), impairs the interaction of NRF2 with PPIA, inducing NRF2 ubiquitination and degradation. Interestingly, CsA interrupts glutamine metabolism mediated by the NRF2/KLF5/SLC1A5 pathway, consequently suppressing the growth of NRF2-hyperactivated NSCLC cells. CsA and a glutaminase inhibitor combination therapy significantly retard tumor progression in NSCLC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with NRF2 hyperactivation. Our study demonstrates that targeting NRF2 protein stability is an actionable therapeutic approach to treat NRF2-hyperactivated NSCLC.",
Tobacco-induced hyperglycemia promotes lung cancer progression via cancer cell-macrophage interaction through paracrine IGF2/IR/NPM1-driven PD-L1 expression,"Hyun-Ji Jang, Hye-Young Min, Yun Pyo Kang, Hye-Jin Boo, Jisung Kim, Jee Hwan Ahn, Seung Ho Oh, Jin Hwa Jung, Choon-Sik Park, Jong-Sook Park, Seog-Young Kim, Ho-Young Lee",2024-06-08,"Tobacco smoking (TS) is implicated in lung cancer (LC) progression through the development of metabolic syndrome. However, direct evidence linking metabolic syndrome to TS-mediated LC progression remains to be established. Our findings demonstrate that 4-(methylnitrosamino)−1-(3-pyridyl)−1-butanone and benzo[a]pyrene (NNK and BaP; NB), components of tobacco smoke, induce metabolic syndrome characteristics, particularly hyperglycemia, promoting lung cancer progression in male C57BL/6 J mice. NB enhances glucose uptake in tumor-associated macrophages by increasing the expression and surface localization of glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 and 3, thereby leading to transcriptional upregulation of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), which subsequently activates insulin receptor (IR) in LC cells in a paracrine manner, promoting its nuclear import. Nuclear IR binds to nucleophosmin (NPM1), resulting in IR/NPM1-mediated activation of the CD274 promoter and expression of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Restricting glycolysis, depleting macrophages, or blocking PD-L1 inhibits NB-mediated LC progression. Analysis of patient tissues and public databases reveals elevated levels of IGF2 and GLUT1 in tumor-associated macrophages, as well as tumoral PD-L1 and phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/insulin receptor (pIGF-1R/IR) expression, suggesting potential poor prognostic biomarkers for LC patients. Our data indicate that paracrine IGF2/IR/NPM1/PD-L1 signaling, facilitated by NB-induced dysregulation of glucose levels and metabolic reprogramming of macrophages, contributes to TS-mediated LC progression.",
Germline functional variants contribute to somatic mutation and outcomes in neuroblastoma,"Eun Seop Seo, Ji Won Lee, Jinyeong Lim, Sunghwan Shin, Hee Won Cho, Hee Young Ju, Keon Hee Yoo, Ki Woong Sung, Woong-Yang Park",2024-09-27,"Germline genetic context may play a significant role in the development and evolution of cancer, particularly in childhood cancers such as neuroblastoma. This study investigates the role of putatively functional germline variants in neuroblastoma, even if they do not directly increase disease risk. Our whole-exome sequencing analysis of 125 patients with neuroblastoma reveals a positive correlation between germline variant burden and somatic mutations. Moreover, patients with higher germline variant burden exhibit worse outcomes. Similar findings are observed in the independent neuroblastoma cohort where a higher germline variant burden correlates with a higher somatic mutational burden and a worse overall survival outcome. However, contrasting results emerge in adult-onset cancer, emphasizing the importance of germline genetics in neuroblastoma. The enrichment of putatively functional germline variants in cancer predisposition genes is borderline significant when compared to healthy populations (P = 0.077; Odds Ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence intervals, 0.94−2.21) and significantly more pronounced against adult-onset cancers (P = 0.016; Odds Ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence intervals, 1.10−3.91). Additionally, the presence of these variants proves to have prognostic significance in neuroblastoma (log-rank P < 0.001), and combining germline with clinical risk factors notably improves survival predictions.",
Survival outcomes after omission of surgery for ductal carcinoma in situ,"Elizabeth C. Poli, Wenli Dong, Simona F. Shaitelman, Nina Tamirisa, Yu Shen, Isabelle Bedrosian",2024-09-20,"Clinical trials of active surveillance (AS) for Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) are underway. We sought to understand the historical management of biologically favorable DCIS and to determine the outcomes of patients who did not have immediate surgery. Using data from the NCDB from 2004 to 2017, the selected cohort included women >40 years of age, with low or intermediate grade and hormone receptor (HR) positive DCIS. AS was defined as either no surgery or surgery >12 months from diagnosis. Women in the AS group were compared to women who had immediate surgery. A Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess the trend of AS over year of diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated to compare overall survival (OS), stratified by age (<50, 50–64, ≥65), and Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the effects of prognostic factors on survival distributions. 74,367 women met study inclusion criteria; 2384 (3.2%) were treated with AS. The proportion of patients in the AS cohort increased yearly, peaking in 2017 at 4.2% (p < 0.01). On multivariable analysis, increasing age (OR 1.02, p < 0.01), black race (OR 1.7, p < 0.001), and being uninsured (OR 2.2, p < 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of AS. In women <50 years of age, OS outcomes were similar, with 10-year OS of 97.4% in the immediate surgery cohort versus 99.1% in AS cohort (p = 0.43). The proportion of patients with DCIS treated with AS has remained small but is increasing over time. AS of biologically favorable DCIS in younger, healthier women is not associated with adverse survival.",

Re-envisioning genetic predisposition to childhood and adolescent cancers,Christian P. Kratz,2024-12-03,"Although cancer is rare in children and adolescents, it remains a leading cause of death within this age range, and genetic predisposition is the main known risk factor. Since the discovery of retinoblastoma-predisposing RB1 pathogenic germline variants in 1985, several additional high-penetrance cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) have been identified. Although few clinically recognizable genetic conditions display moderate cancer phenotypes, burden testing has revealed low-to-moderate penetrance CPGs. In addition to germline pathogenic variants in CPGs, postzygotic somatic mosaic CPG pathogenic variants acquired during embryonic development are increasingly recognized as factors that predispose children and adolescents to malignancies. Genome-wide association studies of various childhood and adolescent cancer types have identified some common low-risk cancer susceptibility alleles. Although the clinical utility of polygenic risk scores is currently limited in children and adolescents, polygenic risk scores developed for adults can predict subsequent cancer risks in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors. In this Review, I describe our current knowledge of genetic predisposition to childhood and adolescent cancers. Survival rates in children and adolescents with cancer and CPGs are often poor, necessitating better integration of genomic testing into clinical care to improve cancer prevention, surveillance and therapies.",
Getting the right combination to break the epigenetic code,"Seda S. Tolu, Aaron D. Viny, Jennifer E. Amengual, Barbara Pro, Susan E. Bates",2024-12-02,"Rapid advances in the field of epigenetics have facilitated the development of novel therapeutics targeting epigenetic mechanisms that are hijacked by cancer cells to support tumour growth and progression. Several epigenetic agents have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of cancer; however, the efficacy of these drugs is dependent on the underlying biology and drivers of the disease, with inherent differences between solid tumours and haematological malignancies. The efficacy of epigenetic drugs as single agents remains limited across most cancer types, which has spurred the clinical development of combination therapies, with the hope of attaining synergistic activity and/or overcoming treatment resistance. In this Review we discuss clinical advances that have been achieved with the use of epigenetic agents in combination with chemotherapies, immunotherapies or other targeted agents, including epigenetic–epigenetic combinations, as well as limitations and challenges associated with these combinatorial strategies. So far, the success of combination therapies targeting epigenetic mechanisms has generally been confined to haematological malignancies, with limited efficacy observed in patients with solid tumours. Nevertheless, this Review captures the field of epigenetic combination therapies across the spectra of haematology and oncology, highlighting opportunities for precision therapy to effectively harness the potential of epigenetic agents and produce meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes.",

Cheah, Carlos Chiattone, Yucai Wang, Meghan Thompson, Paolo Ghia, Justin Taylor, Juan Pablo Alderuccio",2024-11-01,"The B cell receptor (BCR) signalling pathway has an integral role in the pathogenesis of many B cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and Waldenström macroglobulinaemia. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key node mediating signal transduction downstream of the BCR. The advent of BTK inhibitors has revolutionized the treatment landscape of B cell malignancies, with these agents often replacing highly intensive and toxic chemoimmunotherapy regimens as the standard of care. In this Review, we discuss the pivotal trials that have led to the approval of various covalent BTK inhibitors, the current treatment indications for these agents and mechanisms of resistance. In addition, we discuss novel BTK-targeted therapies, including covalent, as well as non-covalent, BTK inhibitors, BTK degraders and combination doublet and triplet regimens, to provide insights on the best current treatment paradigms in the frontline setting and at disease relapse.",
Phase 2 trial of PSMA PET CT versus planar bone scan and CT in prostate cancer patients progressing while on androgen deprivation therapy,"John Nikitas, Andrei Gafita, Matthias R.

This was a single-arm, head-to-head, prospective phase II trial (NCT04928820) designed to enroll 102 men with prostate cancer who experienced biochemical progression (rising prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≥ 1 ng/mL) during ADT. All patients received 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP planar bone scans. Each scan was interpreted by three central independent readers. The primary endpoint was the per-patient bone metastasis detection rate of PSMA PET/CT versus planar bone scan and CT. Secondary endpoints compared the number of bone metastases detected per patient and the inter-reader agreement of each imaging modality. Twenty-two men were enrolled between July 2021 and June 2022. Due to slow accrual following approval of PSMA PET radiotracers in the U.S. and a lack of a statistical signal between the two imaging modalities on interim analysis, this trial was closed early on October 2022. Median PSA was 8.5 ng/mL (interquartile range: 1.6–77.6). There was 100% agreement between the two scans. Six patients (27%) had negative findings and 16 patients (73%) had positive findings on both scans. PSMA PET/CT and bone scan plus CT detected an equal number of bone lesions for 14 patients (64%), PSMA PET/CT detected more bone lesions for six patients (27%), and bone scan plus CT detected more bone lesions for two patients (9.1%) (p = 0.092). The inter-reader agreement rates of PSMA PET/CT and bone scan plus CT were 96% and 82%, respectively (p = 0.25). In men with biochemical progression during ADT, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP planar bone scan plus CT had identical bone metastasis detection rates. Bone scan plus CT can continue to serve as a cost-effective and readily accessible restaging modality in patients with biochemical progression. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04928820.

Immunomic longitudinal profiling of the NeoPembrOv trial identifies drivers of immunoresistance in high-grade ovarian carcinoma,"Olivia Le Saux, Maude Ardin, Justine Berthet, Sarah Barrin, Morgane Bourhis, Justine Cinier, Yasmine Lounici, Isabelle Treilleux, Pierre-Alexandre Just, Guillaume Bataillon, Aude-Marie Savoye, Marie-Ange Mouret-Reynier, Elodie Coquan, Olfa Derbel, Louis Jeay, Suliman Bouizaguen, Intidhar Labidi-Galy, Séverine Tabone-Eglinger, Anthony Ferrari, Emilie Thomas, Christine Ménétrier-Caux, Eric Tartour, Isabelle Galy-Fauroux, Marc-Henri Stern, Magali Terme, Christophe Caux, Bertrand Dubois, Isabelle Ray-Coquard",2024-07-16,"PD-1/PD-L1 blockade has so far shown limited survival benefit for high-grade ovarian carcinomas. By using paired samples from the NeoPembrOv randomized phase II trial (NCT03275506), for which primary outcomes are published, and by combining RNA-seq and multiplexed immunofluorescence staining, we explore the impact of NeoAdjuvant ChemoTherapy (NACT) ± Pembrolizumab (P) on the tumor environment, and identify parameters that correlated with response to immunotherapy as a pre-planned exploratory analysis. Indeed, i) combination therapy results in a significant increase in intraepithelial CD8+PD-1+ T cells, ii) combining endothelial and monocyte gene signatures with the CD8B/FOXP3 expression ratio is predictive of response to NACT + P with an area under the curve of 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-1.00) and iii) high CD8B/FOXP3 and high CD8B/ENTPD1 ratios are significantly associated with positive response to NACT + P, while KDR and VEGFR2 expression are associated with resistance. These results indicate that targeting regulatory T cells and endothelial cells, especially VEGFR2+ endothelial cells, could overcome immune resistance of ovarian cancers.",
Investigating the WNT and TGF-beta pathways alterations and tumor mutation burden in young-onset colorectal cancer,"Morgan Ferrell, Deniz Can Guven, Cyndi Gonzalez Gomez, Elham Nasrollahi, Richard Giza, Svea Cheng, Masood Pasha Syed, Tara Magge, Aatur Singhi, Anwaar Saeed, Turcin Saridogan, Ibrahim Halil Sahin",2024-08-02,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the United States. Recent epidemiological evidence demonstrates an increasing incidence of young-onset CRC cases, defined as CRC cases in individuals 50 years old or younger. Studies have established that alterations in both the WNT and TGF-Beta signaling pathways have contributed to CRC development. While this is well understood, the comprehensive analysis of WNT and TGF-Beta pathway alterations in young-onset CRC cases has yet to be investigated. Here, we conducted a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of mutations associated with each of the WNT and TGF-Beta signaling pathways according to age (≤ 50 years old versus > 50 years old) utilizing published genomic data from the cBioPortal. Chi-square results demonstrated no significant difference in WNT alterations between young-onset CRC and those > 50 years old. However, across all age groups, WNT alterations were frequently found in rectal cancers. We also found that WNT alterations were associated with better outcomes. The mutations associated with TGF-beta were observed at a higher rate in older CRC patients when compared to those ≤ 50 years old. Additionally, these mutations were found more frequently in colon primaries.",
Analysis of influencing factors of acute kidney injury after unilateral nephrectomy,"Yongchao Yan, Yunbo Liu, Bin Li, Shang Xu, Haotian Du, Xinning Wang",2024-10-18,"Unilateral Nephrectomy is one of the most common treatments for surgical diseases of the kidney but often results in postsurgical acute kidney injury (AKI). In the current study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors for AKI in patients who have received Unilateral Nephrectomy. We retrospectively analysed 528 patients who underwent Unilateral Nephrectomy for different etiologies between January 2013 and December 2018 at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. We recorded the prevalence and severity of AKI, age, gender, diabetes, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, preoperative renal function, etiology, performed surgically, anaemia, albumin, coagulation, lactate dehydrogenase, nitrogen (BUN), and uric acid. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the predictors of AKI in patients with Unilateral Nephrectomy. Overall, 218 of the 528 patients (41.2%) developed AKI during their hospitalisation. Univariate analysis showed that AKI was significantly associated with gender (male, OR = 1.866, P = 0.001), overweight (OR = 2.19, P = 0.0002), and surgical approach (OR = 1.7, P = 0.018), while multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that male gender (OR = 1.953, P = 0.001), overweight (OR = 2.176, P = 0.001), and preoperative renal function (OR = 0.507, P = 0.001) were independent factors for AKI. Regression analysis among different etiologies showed significant differences in postoperative AKI. After Unilateral nephrectomy, AKI is more likely to occur in overweight male patients with normal kidney function. AKI occurred more frequently in patients who are kidney donors, but rarely in those with non-function kidneys.","Nephrectomy, Urologic neoplasms, eGFR, Acute kidney injury"
The value of PET/CT radiomics for predicting survival outcomes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"Yeon-koo Kang, Seunggyun Ha, Ji Bong Jeong, So Won Oh",2024-11-22,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with poor prognosis even without distant metastases, necessitating in-depth characterization of primary tumors for survival prediction. We assessed the feasibility of using FDG-PET/CT radiomics to predict overall survival (OS) in PDAC. This retrospective study included PDAC patients without distant metastasis who underwent FDG-PET/CT for initial staging. Primary tumors were segmented from FDG-PET/CT images, extracting 222 radiomics features. A radiomics-based risk score (Rad-score) was developed using Cox proportional hazards regression with LASSO to predict OS. The prognostic performance of the Rad-score was compared with a clinical model (demographics, disease stage, laboratory results) using Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) and bootstrapping. 140 patients were included, with a mortality rate was 72.9% during follow-up (total population, 19.5 ± 19.2 months; survivors, 34.4 ± 28.8 months). Eleven radiomics features were significant for survival prediction. The Rad-score predicted OS with a C-index of 0.681 [95% CI, 0.632–0.731]. A model integrating clinical parameters and Rad-score outperformed the clinical-only model in predicting OS (C-index 0.740 [0.715–0.816] vs. 0.673 [0.650–0.766]; C-index difference 0.067 [0.014–0.113]; P < 0.001). These findings suggest that incorporating FDG-PET/CT radiomics into preexisting prognotic stratification paradiagm may enhance survival prediction in PDAC, warranting large-scale studies to confirm its applicability in clinical practice.","FDG-PET/CT, Pancreas cancer, Radiomics, Survival"

However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting the differences in survival between these two approaches are currently lacking. From September 2017 to January 2020, 300 patients with cT1-4a and N0/+ were enrolled and randomized to either the robotic (RDG) or laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) group (NCT03313700). The primary endpoint was 3-year disease-free survival (DFS); secondary endpoints reported here are the 3-year overall survival (OS) and recurrence patterns. The remaining secondary outcomes include intraoperative outcomes, postoperative recovery, quality of lymphadenectomy, and cost differences, which have previously been reported. There were 283 patients in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (RDG group: n = 141; LDG group: n = 142). The trial has met pre-specified endpoints.

However, the relationship between the TME, usually characterized by immune cell density, and response to ICI is unclear. Here, we quantify the TME immune cell densities and spatial relationships (SRs) of 24 baseline UC samples, obtained before pre-operative combination ICI treatment, using multiplex immunofluorescence. We describe SRs by approximating the first nearest-neighbor distance distribution with a Weibull distribution and evaluate the association between TME metrics and ipilimumab+nivolumab response. Immune cell density does not discriminate between response groups. However, the Weibull SR metrics of CD8+ T cells or macrophages to their closest cancer cell positively associate with response. CD8+ T cells close to B cells are characteristic of non-response. We validate our SR response associations in a combination ICI cohort of head and neck tumors. Our data confirm that SRs, in contrast to density metrics, are strong biomarkers of response to pre-operative combination ICIs.",
Low-dose radiotherapy combined with dual PD-L1 and VEGFA blockade elicits antitumor response in hepatocellular carcinoma mediated by activated intratumoral CD8+ exhausted-like T cells,"Siqi Li, Kun Li, Kang Wang, Haoyuan Yu, Xiangyang Wang, Mengchen Shi, Zhixing Liang, Zhou Yang, Yongwei Hu, Yang Li, Wei Liu, Hua Li, Shuqun Cheng, Linsen Ye, Yang Yang",2023-11-24,"Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) combined with bevacizumab (anti-VEGFA) is the first-line immunotherapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but the number of patients who benefit from this regimen remains limited. Here, we combine dual PD-L1 and VEGFA blockade (DPVB) with low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT), which rapidly inflames tumors, rendering them vulnerable to immunotherapy. The combinatorial therapy exhibits superior antitumor efficacy mediated by CD8+ T cells in various preclinical HCC models. Treatment efficacy relies upon mobilizing exhausted-like CD8+ T cells (CD8+ Tex) with effector function and cytolytic capacity. Mechanistically, LDRT sensitizes tumors to DPVB by recruiting stem-like CD8+ Tpex, the progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells, from draining lymph nodes (dLNs) into the tumor via the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis. Together, these results further support the rationale for combining LDRT with atezolizumab and bevacizumab, and its clinical translation.",
Pre-treatment metastatic biopsy: a step towards precision oncology for urothelial cancer,"Niklas Klümper, Alexander Cox, Gottfrid Sjödahl, Florian Roghmann, Christian Bolenz, Arndt Hartmann, Viktor Grünwald, Bishoy M. Faltas, Michael Hölzel, Markus Eckstein",2024-10-29,"Early metastatic spread and clonal expansion of individual mutations result in a heterogeneous tumour landscape in metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC). Substantial molecular heterogeneity of common drug targets, such as membranous NECTIN4, FGFR3 mutations, PDL1 or immune phenotypes, has been documented between primary and metastatic tumours. However, translational and clinical studies frequently do not account for such heterogeneity and often investigate primary tumour samples that might not be representative in patients with mUC. We propose this as a potential factor for why many biomarkers for mUC have failed to be integrated into clinical practice. Fresh pre-treatment metastatic biopsies enable the capturing of prevailing tumour biology in real time. The characterization of metastatic tumour samples can improve response prediction to immunotherapy, the anti-NECTIN4 antibody–drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin and the FGFR inhibitor erdafitinib. Routine metastatic biopsy can thus improve the precision of identifying driver druggable alterations, thus improving treatment selection for patients with mUC.",

T-cells of HGG patients shifted from naïve to effector memory phenotype. LGG patients exhibited T-cell central memory expansion and higher T-cell activation. Interestingly, HGG patients displayed reduced thymic function. Furthermore, LGG and HGG patients showed reduced activated B-cells and suboptimal B-cell formation. Our data demonstrate that glioma patients have reduced lymphopoiesis at the disease onset, which could contribute to the systemic lymphopenia characterizing these patients.

Delayed tumor-draining lymph node irradiation preserves the efficacy of combined radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade in models of metastatic disease,"Irma Telarovic, Carmen S. M. Yong, Lisa Kurz, Irene Vetrugno, Sabrina Reichl, Alba Sanchez Fernandez, Hung-Wei Cheng, Rona Winkler, Matthias Guckenberger, Anja Kipar, Burkhard Ludewig, Martin Pruschy",2024-06-29,"Cancer resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors motivated investigations into leveraging the immunostimulatory properties of radiotherapy to overcome immune evasion and to improve treatment response. However, clinical benefits of radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations have been modest. Routine concomitant tumor-draining lymph node irradiation (DLN IR) might be the culprit. As crucial sites for generating anti-tumor immunity, DLNs are indispensable for the in situ vaccination effect of radiotherapy. Simultaneously, DLN sparing is often not feasible due to metastatic spread. Using murine models of metastatic disease in female mice, here we demonstrate that delayed (adjuvant), but not neoadjuvant, DLN IR overcomes the detrimental effect of concomitant DLN IR on the efficacy of radio-immunotherapy. Moreover, we identify IR-induced disruption of the CCR7-CCL19/CCL21 homing axis as a key mechanism for the detrimental effect of DLN IR. Our study proposes delayed DLN IR as a strategy to maximize the efficacy of radio-immunotherapy across different tumor types and disease stages.",
Radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy,"Yue Kong, Miaoyi Su, Jun Fang, Mengyuan Chen, Chao Zheng, Youhua Jiang, Kaiyi Tao, Changchun Wang, Guoqin Qiu, Yongling Ji, Yuezhen Wang, Yang Yang",2024-07-17,"With the success of immunotherapy in advanced esophageal cancer, neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy (CIT) is being increasingly used for local staged esophageal cancer, especially in the context of clinical trials, which brings similar pCR with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and shows promising results. However, there is still a part of potentially operable patients can't undergo surgery after neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy. The follow-up treatment and prognosis of this population remain unclear. Patients pathologically diagnosed with ESCC, clinical stage T1-3N+M0 or T3-4aNanyM0 (AJCC 8th), PS 0–1 were retrospectively enrolled from 1/2020 to 6/2021 in Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. All patients firstly received PD-1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy (albumin paclitaxel, 260 mg/m2 on day 1 plus carboplatin AUC = 5 on day 1) every 3 weeks for 2–4 cycles. For those patients who did not receive surgery, definitive radiotherapy with 50.4 Gy/28F or 50 Gy/25F was adopted using VMAT, concurrent with chemotherapy or alone. The concurrent chemotherapy regimens included weekly TC (paclitaxel 50 mg/m2, d1, carboplatin AUC = 2, d1) or S1 (60 mg bid d1–14, 29–42).

Cell hiding in colorectal cancer: correlation with response to chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo,"I. Druzhkova, A. Potapov, N. Ignatova, M. Bugrova, I. Shchechkin, M. Lukina, L. Shimolina, E. Kolesnikova, M. Shirmanova, E. Zagaynova",2024-11-20,"Resistance to chemotherapy remains the main challenge for cancer treatment. One of the mechanisms of tumor escape from cytotoxic agents could be the formation of cell-in-cell (CIC) structures, in which the outer cell protects the inner cell from unfavorable environment. Such structures have been found in many tumor types, however, their link to chemosensitivity is elusive. Here, we tested whether the CIC structures can promote resistance of colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapy. To identify CIC structures in cell cultures and in tumor xenografts, both transmission electron microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy of live and fixed cells as well as tissue slices and histopathology were used. Cytogenetic analysis was performed to detect chromosome instability associated with the drug resistance. It was found that in the five colorectal cancer cell lines intrinsic chemoresistance positively correlated with the ability of cells to spontaneously form CIC structures. Cultured cells treated with oxaliplatin and Irinotecan and tumor xenografts treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI regimens displayed an increased number of CICs after the treatment. The release of the inner cell from CIC structure was observed after removal of the drug. The number of CICs in the cell lines and tumors with acquired resistance to oxaliplatin was higher than in the drug-naive counterparts. The development of chemoresistance was also accompanied by the changes in the cell’s ploidy. These preliminary data clearly demonstrate the associations of CIC structures with chemoresistance of colorectal cancer in cultured cells and tumor xenografts and show the prospect of further clinical validation of CICs as a potential prognostic marker for treatment efficiency.","Cell-in-cell structures, CIC, Chemoresistance, Colorectal cancer, Entosis"

Here, we propose novel radiological features that are specially designed to ensure compatibility across diverse tissues and imaging contrast. These features provide systematic characterization of tumour morphology and spatial heterogeneity. In an international multi-institution study of 1,682 patients, we discover and validate four unifying imaging subtypes across three malignancies and two major imaging modalities. These tumour subtypes demonstrate distinct molecular characteristics and prognoses after conventional therapies. In advanced lung cancer treated with immunotherapy, one subtype is associated with improved survival and increased tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes compared with the others. Deep learning enables automatic tumour segmentation and reproducible subtype identification, which can facilitate practical implementation. The unifying radiological tumour classification may inform prognosis and treatment response for precision medicine.",

By applying an automated single-cell count for immunolabelled LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT, we reveal that individual IR levels with exclusive domination in each tumour can serve as valid biomarkers for profiling human renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We uncover the immunogenomic landscape associated with individual IR levels in human RCC tumours with metastases in various organs and histological subtypes. We then externally validate our results and devise a workflow with optimal biomarker cut-offs for discriminating the LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT tumour profiles.

However, the existing literature on the role of adipocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to elucidate the correlation between obesity and cancer remains insufficient. Here, we aim to investigate the formation of cancer-associated adipocytes (CAAs) and their contribution to tumor growth using mouse models harboring dysfunctional adipocytes. Specifically, we employ adipocyte-specific BECN1 KO (BaKO) mice, which exhibit lipodystrophy due to dysfunctional adipocytes. Our results reveal the activation of YAP/TAZ signaling in both CAAs and BECN1-deficient adipocytes, inducing adipocyte dedifferentiation and formation of a malignant TME. The additional deletion of YAP/TAZ from BaKO mice significantly restores the lipodystrophy and inflammatory phenotypes, leading to tumor regression. Furthermore, mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibit decreased BECN1 and increased YAP/TAZ expression in their adipose tissues. Treatment with the YAP/TAZ inhibitor, verteporfin, suppresses tumor progression in BaKO and HFD-fed mice, highlighting its efficacy against mice with metabolic dysregulation. Overall, our findings provide insights into the key mediators of CAA and their significance in developing a TME, thereby suggesting a viable approach targeting adipocyte homeostasis to suppress cancer growth.",
Radiomics nomogram for predicting chemo-immunotherapy efficiency in advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"Hua Jin, Yuchao Wang, Xushuo Li, Ying Yang, Ruixue Qi",2024-09-06,"This study aimed to explore potential radiomics biomarkers in predicting the efficiency of chemo-immunotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eligible patients were prospectively assigned to receive chemo-immunotherapy, and were divided into a primary cohort (n = 138) and an internal validation cohort (n = 58). Additionally, a separative dataset was used as an external validation cohort (n = 60). Radiomics signatures were extracted and selected from the primary tumor sites from chest CT images. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the independent clinical predictors. Subsequently, a radiomics nomogram model for predicting the efficiency of chemo-immunotherapy was conducted by integrating the selected radiomics signatures and the independent clinical predictors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated that the radiomics model, the clinical model, and the radiomics nomogram model achieved areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78–0.92), 0.76 (95% CI 0.68–0.84), and 0.89 (95% CI 0.84–0.94), respectively, in the primary cohort. In the internal validation cohort, the corresponding AUCs were 0.93 (95% CI 0.86–1.00), 0.79 (95% CI 0.68–0.91), and 0.96 (95% CI 0.90–1.00) respectively.

These results underline the pervasiveness of molecular sex differences and strengthen the call for increased consideration of sex in molecular cancer research.",

A previously observed relationship between MPB and skin cancer may be due to greater exposure to ultraviolet radiation or indicate a role for androgenic pathways in the pathogenesis of skin cancers. We dissected this relationship via Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, using genetic data from recent male-only meta-analyses of cutaneous melanoma (12,232 cases; 20,566 controls) and keratinocyte cancers (KCs) (up to 17,512 cases; >100,000 controls), followed by stratified MR analysis by body-sites. We found strong associations between MPB and the risk of KC, but not with androgens, and multivariable models revealed that this relationship was heavily confounded by MPB single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in pigmentation pathways. Site-stratified MR analyses revealed strong associations between MPB with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, suggesting that sun exposure on the scalp, rather than androgens, is the main driver. Men with less hair covering likely explains, at least in part, the higher incidence of melanoma in men residing in countries with high ambient UV.",

Polymeric nanocarrier via metabolism regulation mediates immunogenic cell death with spatiotemporal orchestration for cancer immunotherapy,"Yichen Guo, Yongjuan Li, Mengzhe Zhang, Rong Ma, Yayun Wang, Xiao Weng, Jinjie Zhang, Zhenzhong Zhang, Xiaoyuan Chen, Weijing Yang",2024-10-04,"The limited efficacy of cancer immunotherapy occurs due to the lack of spatiotemporal orchestration of adaptive immune response stimulation and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment modulation. Herein, we report a nanoplatform fabricated using a pH-sensitive triblock copolymer synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization enabling in situ tumor vaccination and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization. The nanocarrier itself can induce melanoma immunogenic cell death (ICD) via tertiary amines and thioethers concentrating on mitochondria to regulate metabolism in triggering endoplasmic reticulum stress and upregulating gasdermin D for pyroptosis as well as some features of ferroptosis and apoptosis. After the addition of ligand cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (cRGD) and mannose, the mixed nanocarrier with immune adjuvant resiquimod encapsulation can target B16F10 cells for in situ tumor vaccination and TAMs for M1 phenotype polarization. In vivo studies indicate that the mixed targeting nanoplatform elicits tumor ICD, dendritic cell maturation, TAM polarization, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration and inhibits melanoma volume growth. In combination with immune checkpoint blockade, the survival time of mice is markedly prolonged. This study provides a strategy for utilizing immunoactive materials in the innate and adaptive immune responses to augment cancer therapy.",
Using machine learning to develop a stacking ensemble learning model for the CT radiomics classification of brain metastases,"Huai-wen Zhang, Yi-ren Wang, Bo Hu, Bo Song, Zhong-jian Wen, Lei Su, Xiao-man Chen, Xi Wang, Ping Zhou, Xiao-ming Zhong, Hao-wen Pang, You-hua Wang",2024-11-19,"The objective of this study was to explore the potential of machine-learning techniques in the automatic identification and classification of brain metastases from a radiomic perspective, aiming to improve the accuracy of tumor volume assessment for radiotherapy. By using various machine-learning algorithms, including random forest, support vector machine, gradient boosting machine, XGBoost, decision tree, artificial neural network, k-nearest neighbors, LightGBM, and CatBoost algorithms, a stacking ensemble model was developed to classify gross tumor volume (GTV), brainstem, and normal brain tissue based on radiomic features. Multiple evaluation metrics, including the specificity, sensitivity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient, and the Youden index, were used to assess the model’s performance. The stacked ensemble model integrated the strengths of the nine base models and consistently outperformed individual base models in classifying GTV (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.928), brainstem (AUC = 0.932), and normal brain tissue (AUC = 0.942). Among the base models, the support vector machine model demonstrated the best performance in the three classifications (AUC = 0.922, 0.909, and 0.928). The higher performance of the stacked ensemble model highlighted the low performance of other models, including the decision tree (AUC = 0.709, 0.706, 0.804) and k-nearest neighbors (AUC = 0.721, 0.663, 0.729) models in certain contexts, such as when faced with high-dimensional feature spaces. While machine learning shows significant promise in medical image analysis, relying solely on a single model may lead to suboptimal results. By combining the strengths of various algorithms, the stacking ensemble model offers a better solution for the classification of brain metastases based on radiomic features.","Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Prediction model, Radiomics, Stacking ensemble learning"

Here we generated murine CAR-NKT cells and compared them with CAR-T cells in immune-competent mice. Both CAR-NKT cells and CAR-T cells showed similar antitumor effects in vitro, but CAR-NKT cells showed superior antitumor activity in vivo via CD1d-dependent immune responses in the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we show that CAR-NKT cells eliminate CD1d-expressing M2-like macrophages. In addition, CAR-NKT cells promote epitope spreading and activation of endogenous T cell responses against tumor-associated neoantigens. Finally, we observed that CAR-NKT cells can co-express PD1 and TIM3 and show an exhaustion phenotype in a model of high tumor burden. PD1 blockade as well as vaccination augmented the antitumor activity of CAR-NKT cells. In summary, our results demonstrate the multimodal function of CAR-NKT cells in solid tumors, further supporting the rationale for developing CAR-NKT therapies in the clinic.",

We find that MSE-derived cancer cells retain the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of their corresponding primary tumors, validating their use as a patient-relevant model system for solid tumor biology. Integrative analyses reveal that baseline gene expression patterns relate to global ex vivo drug sensitivity, while high-throughput drug-induced transcriptional changes in MSE samples are indicative of drug mode of action and acquired treatment resistance. A case study exemplifies the added value of multi-modal MSE profiling for patients who lack genetically stratified treatment options. In summary, our study provides a functional multi-omics view on a pan-cancer solid tumor cohort and underlines the feasibility and utility of MSE-based precision oncology.",
Comprehensive model for simultaneous monitoring of primary tumor to metastatic cancer utilizing Prkdc and Il2rg double knockout mice,"Hee Jung Kwon, Jang Woo Park, Hye Kyung Chung, Joohee Jung",2024-10-09,"Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, motivating major scientific efforts to understand and treat this cancer type. Over 30% of patients with liver cancer progress to metastasis, which reduces the survival rate. Extensive studies on primary tumors have been conducted to improve the prognosis. However, there is a lack of appropriate and accessible models for studying the progression and metastasis of liver cancer. Moreover, conventional metastasis models do not reproduce metastasis as it occurs in patients. To address this lack of an appropriate model for the monitoring of cancer progression and evaluation of anticancer drugs, we established a spontaneous metastatic xenograft model using NSG mice subcutaneously transplanted with SK-Hep-1 cells. Compared to the conventional experimental metastasis model (intravenous transplantation), in which only lung metastasis was observed, the established spontaneous metastatic xenograft model was superior, as it showed both a primary tumor and metastatic patterns similar to those observed in human patients. Additionally, this model was successfully used to assess the antimetastatic efficacy of sorafenib. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the established spontaneous metastatic xenograft model better reflects liver cancer metastasis and can be utilized to assess the efficacy of anticancer drugs for liver cancer.","Liver neoplasms, Mice, Neoplastic processes, Sorafenib, Survival rate, Xenografts"

However, systematic identification of patient-specific treatments that selectively co-inhibit cancerous cell populations poses a combinatorial challenge, since the number of possible drug-dose combinations vastly exceeds what could be tested in patient cells. Here, we describe a machine learning approach, scTherapy, which leverages single-cell transcriptomic profiles to prioritize multi-targeting treatment options for individual patients with hematological cancers or solid tumors. Patient-specific treatments reveal a wide spectrum of co-inhibitors of multiple biological pathways predicted for primary cells from heterogenous cohorts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, each with unique resistance patterns and synergy mechanisms. Experimental validations confirm that 96% of the multi-targeting treatments exhibit selective efficacy or synergy, and 83% demonstrate low toxicity to normal cells, highlighting their potential for therapeutic efficacy and safety. In a pan-cancer analysis across five cancer types, 25% of the predicted treatments are shared among the patients of the same tumor type, while 19% of the treatments are patient-specific. Our approach provides a widely-applicable strategy to identify personalized treatment regimens that selectively co-inhibit malignant cells and avoid inhibition of non-cancerous cells, thereby increasing their likelihood for clinical success.",

Patients were enrolled in a phase I/II study. In phase I (dose-escalation), patients received anlotinib (8, 10, 12 mg) plus benmelstobart (1200 mg). Recommended phase II dose, determined during phase I, was used in phase II dose-expansion cohort. Primary endpoints were maximum tolerable dose in phase I and progression-free survival (PFS) in phase II. At the data cutoff date (March 10, 2024), 55 patients were enrolled in phase II dose-expansion cohort. Median PFS of patients included in phase II cohort was 9.0 months, median overall survival was 28.9 months, objective response rate was 25.5%, disease control rate was 87.3%, and median duration of response was 19.8 months.

Preoperative scoring system for the prediction of risk of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer,"Mu Xu, Xiaoyan Xie, Liangzhi Cai, DaBin Liu, Pengming Sun",2024-10-11,"The study aimed to develop and validate a preoperative scoring system to predict the risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in cervical cancer (CC). A total of 426 stage IB1–IIA1 CC patients were randomly divided into two sets. A logistic regression model was used to determine independent factors that contribute to LNM. A preoperative scoring system was developed based on beta (β) coefficients. An area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was used to test for model discrimination. Five-year overall survival (OS) rate was 91.7%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that FIGO stage, tumor size, depth of invasion on MRI, and squamous cell carcinoma antigen levels were independent risk factors in the development set (all P < 0.05). The AUCs of the scoring system for the development and validation sets were 0.833 (95% CI = 0.757–0.909) and 0.767 (95% CI = 0.634–0.891), respectively. Patients who scored 0–2, 3–5, and 6–8 were classified into low-risk, medium-risk, and high-risk groups. Predicted rates were in accord with observed rates in both sets. The 5-year OS rates of the new groups were also significantly different for the entire group, development set, and validation set (all P < 0.05). LNM affects the prognosis of CC patients. The scoring system can be used to assist in evaluating the risk of LNM in CC patients preoperatively. It is easy to obtain and can provide reference for clinical treatment decision-making.","Cervical cancer, Lymph node metastasis, Risk factor, Scoring system, Prognosis"
MYO1F regulates T-cell activation and glycolytic metabolism by promoting the acetylation of GAPDH,"Zhihui Cui, Heping Wang, Xiong Feng, Chuyu Wu, Ming Yi, Ruirui He, Ting Pan, Ru Gao, Lingyun Feng, Bo Zeng, Guoling Huang, Yuan Wang, Yanyun Du, Cun-jin Zhang, Xue Xiao, Chenhui Wang",2024-12-13,"Proper cellular metabolism in T cells is critical for a productive immune response. However, when dysregulated by intrinsic or extrinsic metabolic factors, T cells may contribute to a wide spectrum of diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune diseases. However, the metabolic regulation of T cells remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that MYO1F is required for human and mouse T-cell activation after TCR stimulation and that T-cell-specific Myo1f knockout mice exhibit an increased tumor burden and attenuated EAE severity due to impaired T-cell activation in vivo. Mechanistically, after TCR stimulation, MYO1F is phosphorylated by LCK at tyrosines 607 and 634, which is critical for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) acetylation at Lys84, 86 and 227 mediated by α-TAT1, which is an acetyltransferase, and these processes are important for its activation, cellular glycolysis and thus the effector function of T cells. Importantly, we show that a fusion protein of VAV1-MYO1F, a recurrent peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL)-associated oncogenic protein, promotes hyperacetylation of GAPDH and its activation, which leads to aberrant glycolysis and T-cell proliferation, and that inhibition of the activity of GAPDH significantly limits T-cell activation and proliferation and extends the survival of hVAV1-MYO1F knock-in mice. Moreover, hyperacetylation of GAPDH was confirmed in human PTCL patient samples containing the VAV1-MYO1F gene fusion. Overall, this study revealed not only the mechanisms by which MYO1F regulates T-cell metabolism and VAV1-MYO1F fusion-induced PTCL but also promising therapeutic targets for the treatment of PTCL.","T cell activation, MYO1F, GAPDH, VAV1-MYO1F fusion, Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL)"

Eligible patients who had been histologically proven AGC with T3/4NxM0 stage are randomly assigned (1:1) to either surgery alone or surgery plus EIPL. The results of the two groups are analyzed in the intent-to-treat population. A total of 662 patients with AGC (329 patients in the surgery alone group, and 333 in the surgery plus EIPL group) are included in the study. The primary endpoint is 3-year overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoints include 3-year disease free survival (DFS), 3-year peritoneal recurrence-free survival (reported in this manuscript) and 30-day postoperative complication and mortality (previously reported). The trial meets pre-specified endpoints. Estimated 3-year OS rates are 68.5% in the surgery alone group and 70.6% in the surgery plus EIPL group (log-rank p = 0.77). 3-year DFS rates are 61.2% in the surgery alone group and 66.0% in the surgery plus EIPL group (log-rank p = 0.24). The pattern of disease recurrence is similar in the two groups. In conclusion, EIPL does not improve the 3-year survival rate in AGC patients.",

While consensus guidelines recommend surgery followed by stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for lesions >3 cm, smaller lesions (≤3 cm) treated with SRS alone elicit variable responses. To determine factors influencing this variable response to SRS, we analyzed outcomes of brain metastases ≤3 cm diameter in patients with no prior systemic therapy treated with frame-based single-fraction SRS. Following SRS, 259 out of 1733 (15%) treated lesions demonstrated MRI findings concerning for local treatment failure (LTF), of which 202 /1733 (12%) demonstrated LTF and 54/1733 (3%) had an adverse radiation effect. Multivariate analysis demonstrated tumor size (>1.5 cm) and melanoma histology were associated with higher LTF rates. Our results demonstrate that brain metastases ≤3 cm are not uniformly responsive to SRS and suggest that prospective studies to evaluate the effect of SRS alone or in combination with surgery on brain metastases ≤3 cm matched by tumor size and histology are warranted. These studies will help establish multi-disciplinary treatment guidelines that improve local control while minimizing radiation necrosis during treatment of brain metastasis ≤3 cm.",
Biodegradable copper-iodide clusters modulate mitochondrial function and suppress tumor growth under ultralow-dose X-ray irradiation,"Xiaoqian Ma, Nuo Lin, Qing Yang, Peifei Liu, Haizhen Ding, Mengjiao Xu, Fangfang Ren, Zhiyang Shen, Ke Hu, Shanshan Meng, Hongmin Chen",2024-09-16,"Both copper (Cu2+/+) and iodine (I−) are essential elements in all living organisms. Increasing the intracellular concentrations of Cu or I ions may efficiently inhibit tumor growth. However, efficient delivery of Cu and I ions into tumor cells is still a challenge, as Cu chelation and iodide salts are highly water-soluble and can release in untargeted tissue. Here we report mitochondria-targeted Cu-I cluster nanoparticles using the reaction of Cu+ and I− to form stable bovine serum albumin (BSA) radiation-induced phosphors (Cu-I@BSA). These solve the stability issues of Cu+ and I− ions. Cu-I@BSA exhibit bright radioluminescence, and easily conjugate with the emission-matched photosensitizer and targeting molecule using functional groups on the surface of BSA. Investigations in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that radioluminescence under low-dose X-ray irradiation excites the conjugated photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen, and combines with the radiosensitization mechanism of the heavy atom of iodine, resulting in efficient tumor inhibition in female mice. Furthermore, our study reveals that BSA protection causes the biodegradable Cu-I clusters to release free Cu and I ions and induce cell death by modulating mitochondrial function, damaging DNA, disrupting the tricarboxylic acid cycle, decreasing ATP generation, amplifying oxidative stress, and boosting the Bcl-2 pathway.",

Chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure attenuates autoimmunity through promotion of poorly understood immune-suppressive mechanisms. Here we show that mice with subcutaneous melanoma are not responsive to anti-PD1 immunotherapy following chronic UV irradiation, given prior to tumor injection, due to the suppression of T cell killing ability in skin-draining lymph nodes. Using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA-sequencing analyzes, we discover that skin-specific, UV-induced suppression of T-cells killing activity is mediated by upregulation of a Ly6ahigh T-cell subpopulation. Independently of the UV effect, Ly6ahigh T cells are induced by chronic type-1 interferon in the tumor microenvironment. Treatment with an anti-Ly6a antibody enhances the anti-tumoral cytotoxic activity of T cells and reprograms their mitochondrial metabolism via the Erk/cMyc axis. Treatment with an anti-Ly6a antibody inhibits tumor growth in mice resistant to anti-PD1 therapy. Applying our findings in humans could lead to an immunotherapy treatment for patients with resistance to existing treatments.",
Effect of replanning boost radiotherapy plan in locally advanced unresectable middle to lower thoracic esophageal cancer,"Hiroyuki Inoo, Katsuyuki Sakanaka, Takashi Mizowaki",2024-10-07,"Thoracic bulky esophageal cancer shrinks during radiotherapy, changing the location and shape of the surrounding heart and lungs. The current study aimed to explore how replanning by volumetric-modulated arc radiotherapy (VMAT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) influences the target coverage and dose to organs at risk in locally advanced unresectable middle to lower thoracic esophageal cancer. We retrospectively collected CT simulation images of initial and boost radiotherapy plans for locally advanced unresectable thoracic esophageal cancer in 17 consecutive patients. First, we created boost plans of 20 Gy using 3DCRT and VMAT on the initially acquired CT images. Second, we replicated the process on CT images acquired after 20–40 Gy of radiotherapy. We then compared non-replanned boost radiotherapy plans with replanned boost plans. Replanned radiotherapy delivered more conformal doses to the target and reduced heart and lung doses. VMAT reduced more irradiated mean doses to the heart than 3DCRT in the case of replanning (1.7 and 1.1 Gy, p < 0.001). Replanning to accommodate tumor shrinkage during radiotherapy effectively lowers the irradiated doses to the heart and lungs in patients with locally advanced unresectable middle to lower thoracic esophageal cancer, especially those treated with VMAT.","Esophageal cancer, Volumetric-modulated arc therapy, Planning study, Adaptive replanning"

When the hypothetical risk of recurrence mimicked ctDNA negativity, significantly less participants were accepting of adjuvant capecitabine versus no therapy. When presented with ctDNA positivity and increased recurrence risk, the degree of benefit impacted acceptability more than the toxicity profile. As genomic technology advances and ctDNA assays become commercially available, it is imperative to understand the impact on patient decision-making.",
Role of 18F-FDG-PET/CT in the initial staging of very high-risk Ewing Sarcoma in a prospective multicentric Phase II Study: Is there still a place for bone marrow sampling?,"Nina Jehanno, Nadège Corradini, Nathalie Gaspar, Mehdi Brahmi, Thibaud Valentin, Gabriel Revon Rivière, Cyril Lervat, Jamie Probert, Natacha Entz-Werle, Ludovic Mansuy, Dominique Plantaz, Maria Rios, Laure Saumet, Cécile Verité, Marie-Pierre Castex, Estelle Thebaud, Thibaut Cassou-Mounat, Anne-Sophie Plissonnier, Veronique Mosseri, Camille Cordero, Valerie Laurence",2024-10-08,"BackgroundThe Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) constitutes a group of rare malignancies, wherein approximately one-third of cases exhibit metastatic spread, particularly impacting prognosis when bone and/or bone marrow (BM) are involved. Primary extra-pulmonary metastatic ESFT often necessitates intensified therapeutic approaches. Accurate staging plays a pivotal role in clinical decision-making, with fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) currently serving as a non-invasive modality for assessing ESFT’s BM extent.MethodsIn the French phase II COMBINAIR3 (NCT03011528) study, a comprehensive approach for patients with extra-pulmonary ESFT metastasis was evaluated. We prospectively compared the efficacy of PET/CT to BM aspiration and biopsy (BMAB) analysis in patients undergoing initial staging.ResultsAmong the 42 patients analyzed (median age 14 y, 2:1 male/female ratio), 45% presented with pelvic primary tumors and 83% had bone/BM involvement at diagnosis. Our findings showed PET/CT had 100% specificity and 83.3% sensitivity in detecting initial BM involvement. Overall, PET/CT correctly classified 92.8% of patients, reaching 100% accuracy in patients identified with bone involvement, thus surpassing the standard BMAB.DiscussionThese results suggest that the conventional use of BMAB in the initial staging of high-risk ESFT patients can be omitted, promoting PET/CT as a non-invasive alternative, thus improving staging accuracy and treatment decisions in ESFT management.",
Elective nodal irradiation mitigates local and systemic immunity generated by combination radiation and immunotherapy in head and neck tumors,"Laurel B. Darragh, Jacob Gadwa, Tiffany T.

Karam",2022-11-16,"In the setting of conventional radiation therapy, even when combined with immunotherapy, head and neck cancer often recurs locally and regionally. Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) is commonly employed to decrease regional recurrence. Given our developing understanding that immune cells are radio-sensitive, and that T cell priming occurs in the draining lymph nodes (DLNs), we hypothesize that radiation therapy directed at the primary tumor only will increase the effectiveness of immunotherapies. We find that ENI increases local, distant, and metastatic tumor growth. Multi-compartmental analysis of the primary/distant tumor, the DLNs, and the blood shows that ENI decreases the immune response systemically. Additionally, we find that ENI decreases antigen-specific T cells and epitope spreading. Treating the primary tumor with radiation and immunotherapy, however, fails to reduce regional recurrence, but this is reversed by either concurrent sentinel lymph node resection or irradiation. Our data support using lymphatic sparing radiation therapy for head and neck cancer.",
Temporal evolution and differential patterns of cellular reconstitution after therapy for childhood cancers,"Gina Hofmann, Jakob Zierk, Bettina Sobik, Zofia Wotschofsky, Stephanie Sembill, Manuela Krumbholz, Markus Metzler, Axel Karow",2023-03-10,"The cellular reconstitution after childhood cancer therapy is associated with the risk of infection and efficacy of revaccination. Many studies have described the reconstitution after stem cell transplantation (SCT). The recovery after cancer treatment in children who have not undergone SCT has mainly been investigated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), less for solid tumors. Here, we have examined the temporal evolution of total leukocyte, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts as surrogate parameters for the post-therapeutic immune recovery in a cohort of n = 52 patients with ALL in comparison to n = 58 patients with Hodgkin’s disease (HD) and n = 22 patients with Ewing sarcoma (ES). Patients with ALL showed an efficient increase in blood counts reaching the age-adjusted lower limits of normal between 4 and 5 months after the end of maintenance therapy. The two groups of patients with HD and ES exhibited a comparably delayed recovery of total leukocytes due to a protracted post-therapeutic lymphopenia which was most pronounced in patients with HD after irradiation. Overall, we observed a clearly more efficient resurgence of total lymphocyte counts in patients aged below 12 years compared to patients aged 12 to 18 years. Our results underline that the kinetics of cellular reconstitution after therapy for HD and ES differ significantly from ALL and depend on treatment regimens and modalities as well as on patient age. This suggests a need for disease, treatment, and age specific recommendations concerning the duration of infection prophylaxis and the timing of revaccination.",
Brachytherapy via a depot of biopolymer-bound 131I synergizes with nanoparticle paclitaxel in therapy-resistant pancreatic tumours,"Jeffrey L. Schaal, Jayanta Bhattacharyya, Jeremy Brownstein, Kyle C. Strickland, Garrett Kelly, Soumen Saha, Joshua Milligan, Samagya Banskota, Xinghai Li, Wenge Liu, David G. Kirsch, Michael R. Zalutsky, Ashutosh Chilkoti",2022-10-19,"Locally advanced pancreatic tumours are highly resistant to conventional radiochemotherapy. Here we show that such resistance can be surmounted by an injectable depot of thermally responsive elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) conjugated with iodine-131 radionuclides (131I-ELP) when combined with systemically delivered nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel. This combination therapy induced complete tumour regressions in diverse subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models of locoregional pancreatic tumours. 131I-ELP brachytherapy was effective independently of the paclitaxel formulation and dose, but external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) only achieved tumour-growth inhibition when co-administered with nanoparticle paclitaxel. Histological analyses revealed that 131I-ELP brachytherapy led to changes in the expression of intercellular collagen and junctional proteins within the tumour microenvironment. These changes, which differed from those of EBRT-treated tumours, correlated with the improved delivery and accumulation of paclitaxel nanoparticles within the tumour. Our findings support the further translational development of 131I-ELP depots for the synergistic treatment of localized pancreatic cancer.",
Targeting branched N-glycans and fucosylation sensitizes ovarian tumors to immune checkpoint blockade,"Hao Nie, Pratima Saini, Taito Miyamoto, Liping Liao, Rafal J.

Claiborne, Nan Zhang, Mohamed Abdel-Mohsen, Rugang Zhang",2024-04-02,"Aberrant glycosylation is a crucial strategy employed by cancer cells to evade cellular immunity. However, it’s unclear whether homologous recombination (HR) status-dependent glycosylation can be therapeutically explored. Here, we show that the inhibition of branched N-glycans sensitizes HR-proficient, but not HR-deficient, epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs) to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). In contrast to fucosylation whose inhibition sensitizes EOCs to anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy regardless of HR-status, we observe an enrichment of branched N-glycans on HR-proficient compared to HR-deficient EOCs. Mechanistically, BRCA1/2 transcriptionally promotes the expression of MGAT5, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing branched N-glycans. The branched N-glycans on HR-proficient tumors augment their resistance to anti-PD-L1 by enhancing its binding with PD-1 on CD8+ T cells. In orthotopic, syngeneic EOC models in female mice, inhibiting branched N-glycans using 2-Deoxy-D-glucose sensitizes HR-proficient, but not HR-deficient EOCs, to anti-PD-L1. These findings indicate branched N-glycans as promising therapeutic targets whose inhibition sensitizes HR-proficient EOCs to ICB by overcoming immune evasion.",

In our multi-institutional study of 394 NSCLC patients, we utilize pre-treatment computed tomography (CT) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) to establish a habitat imaging framework for assessing regional heterogeneity within individual tumors. This framework identifies three PET/CT subtypes, which maintain prognostic value after adjusting for clinicopathologic risk factors including tumor volume. Additionally, these subtypes complement ctDNA in predicting disease recurrence. Radiogenomics analysis unveil the molecular underpinnings of these imaging subtypes, highlighting downregulation in interferon alpha and gamma pathways in the high-risk subtype. In summary, our study demonstrates that these habitat imaging subtypes effectively stratify NSCLC patients based on their risk levels for disease recurrence after initial curative surgery or radiotherapy, providing valuable insights for personalized treatment approaches.",
The physiological interactome of TCR-like antibody therapeutics in human tissues,"Estelle Marrer-Berger, Annalisa Nicastri, Angelique Augustin, Vesna Kramar, Hanqing Liao, Lydia Jasmin Hanisch, Alejandro Carpy, Tina Weinzierl, Evelyne Durr, Nathalie Schaub, Ramona Nudischer, Daniela Ortiz-Franyuti, Ekaterina Breous-Nystrom, Janick Stucki, Nina Hobi, Giulia Raggi, Lauriane Cabon, Emmanuelle Lezan, Pablo Umaña, Isaac Woodhouse, Alexander Bujotzek, Christian Klein, Nicola Ternette",2024-04-16,"Selective binding of TCR-like antibodies that target a single tumour-specific peptide antigen presented by human leukocyte antigens (HLA) is the absolute prerequisite for their therapeutic suitability and patient safety. To date, selectivity assessment has been limited to peptide library screening and predictive modeling. We developed an experimental platform to de novo identify interactomes of TCR-like antibodies directly in human tissues using mass spectrometry. As proof of concept, we confirm the target epitope of a MAGE-A4-specific TCR-like antibody. We further determine cross-reactive peptide sequences for ESK1, a TCR-like antibody with known off-target activity, in human liver tissue. We confirm off-target-induced T cell activation and ESK1-mediated liver spheroid killing. Off-target sequences feature an amino acid motif that allows a structural groove-coordination mimicking that of the target peptide, therefore allowing the interaction with the engager molecule. We conclude that our strategy offers an accurate, scalable route for evaluating the non-clinical safety profile of TCR-like antibody therapeutics prior to first-in-human clinical application.",

Several immune- and tumor intrinsic features are associated with clinical response at baseline. However, we need to further understand the molecular changes occurring during development of ICB resistance. Here, we collect biopsies from a cohort of 44 patients with melanoma after progression on anti-CTLA4 or anti-PD1 monotherapy. Genetic alterations of antigen presentation and interferon gamma signaling pathways are observed in approximately 25% of ICB resistant cases. Anti-CTLA4 resistant lesions have a sustained immune response, including immune-regulatory features, as suggested by multiplex spatial and T cell receptor (TCR) clonality analyses. One anti-PD1 resistant lesion harbors a distinct immune cell niche, however, anti-PD1 resistant tumors are generally immune poor with non-expanded TCR clones. Such immune poor microenvironments are associated with melanoma cells having a de-differentiated phenotype lacking expression of MHC-I molecules. In addition, anti-PD1 resistant tumors have reduced fractions of PD1+ CD8+ T cells as compared to ICB naïve metastases. Collectively, these data show the complexity of ICB resistance and highlight differences between anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 resistance that may underlie differential clinical outcomes of therapy sequence and combination.",
Single-cell profiling identifies pre-existing CD19-negative subclones in a B-ALL patient with CD19-negative relapse after CAR-T therapy,"Tracy Rabilloud, Delphine Potier, Saran Pankaew, Mathis Nozais, Marie Loosveld, Dominique Payet-Bornet",2021-02-08,"Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) targeting the CD19 antigen represents an innovative therapeutic approach to improve the outcome of relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Yet, despite a high initial remission rate, CAR-T therapy ultimately fails for some patients. Notably, around half of relapsing patients develop CD19 negative (CD19neg) B-ALL allowing leukemic cells to evade CD19-targeted therapy. Herein, we investigate leukemic cells of a relapsing B-ALL patient, at two-time points: before (T1) and after (T2) anti-CD19 CAR-T treatment. We show that at T2, the B-ALL relapse is CD19 negative due to the expression of a non-functional CD19 transcript retaining intron 2. Then, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) approach, we demonstrate that CD19neg leukemic cells were present before CAR-T cell therapy and thus that the relapse results from the selection of these rare CD19neg B-ALL clones. In conclusion, our study shows that scRNAseq profiling can reveal pre-existing CD19neg subclones, raising the possibility to assess the risk of targeted therapy failure.",
Enhanced tumor response to adoptive T cell therapy with PHD2/3-deficient CD8 T cells,"Tereza Dvorakova, Veronica Finisguerra, Matteo Formenti, Axelle Loriot, Loubna Boudhan, Jingjing Zhu, Benoit J. Van den Eynde",2024-09-06,"While adoptive cell therapy has shown success in hematological malignancies, its potential against solid tumors is hindered by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In recent years, members of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family have gained recognition as important regulators of T-cell metabolism and function. The role of HIF signalling in activated CD8 T cell function in the context of adoptive cell transfer, however, has not been explored in full depth. Here we utilize CRISPR-Cas9 technology to delete prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHD) 2 and 3, thereby stabilizing HIF-1 signalling, in CD8 T cells that have already undergone differentiation and activation, modelling the T cell phenotype utilized in clinical settings. We observe a significant boost in T-cell activation and effector functions following PHD2/3 deletion, which is dependent on HIF-1α, and is accompanied by an increased glycolytic flux. This improvement in CD8 T cell performance translates into an enhancement in tumor response to adoptive T cell therapy in mice, across various tumor models, even including those reported to be extremely resistant to immunotherapeutic interventions. These findings hold promise for advancing CD8 T-cell based therapies and overcoming the immune suppression barriers within challenging tumor microenvironments.",

The primary endpoint of this study is objective response rate (ORR), and the secondary endpoints are complete remission (CR) rate, duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). A total of 66 patients are enrolled mostly with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The ORR is 54.5% and CR rate is 31.8% meeting the primary end point. The median DoR is 12.9 months, and 1-year PFS and OS rate is 33.1% and 67.5% respectively. Adverse events (AE) are manageable with the most frequent AE being neutropenia (31.8%). Patients with MYD88 mutations, subtypes known for NF-κB activation, and high BTK expression by immunohistochemistry respond well. Overall, these results show a significant efficacy of the R2A regimen in patients with aggressive R/R B-cell NHL, with exploratory biomarkers suggesting potential associations with response.

We find that tuning the hydrophobicity of nanoparticle core composition with non-ionizable monomers can enhance cellular association of HUNPs by more than ten-fold, resulting in a high cellular internalization efficiency of HUNPs with up to 50% in tumours. Combining high tumour accumulation and high cell internalization efficiency, HUNPs show orthogonally amplified fluorescence signals, permitting the precise locating and delineating margins between malignant lesions and normal tissues with high contrast-to-noise ratio and resolution.

Among 3.131 million, 40696 gastric, 35707 colorectal, 21309 liver, 11532 pancreatic, 4225 gallbladder, and 7051 biliary cancers are newly detected. The persistent low HDL-C group increases the risk of gastric, liver, and biliary cancer comparing to persistent normal HDL-C group. HDL-C change from normal to low level increases the risk for gastric, colorectal, liver, pancreatic, gallbladder, and biliary cancers. Effects of HDL-C change on the gastrointestinal cancer risk are also modified by sex and smoking status. HDL-C changes affect the gastric and gallbladder cancer risk in age ≥60 years and the pancreatic and biliary cancer risk in age <60 years.

Vasculogenic mimicry formation in EBV-associated epithelial malignancies,"Tong Xiang, Yu-Xin Lin, Wenlong Ma, Hao-Jiong Zhang, Ke-Ming Chen, Gui-Ping He, Xiao Zhang, Miao Xu, Qi-Sheng Feng, Ming-Yuan Chen, Mu-Sheng Zeng, Yi-Xin Zeng, Lin Feng",2018-11-27,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated epithelial cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and approximately 10% of gastric cancers, termed EBVaGC, represent 80% of all EBV-related malignancies. However, the exact role of EBV in epithelial cancers remains elusive. Here, we report that EBV functions in vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Epithelial cancer cells infected with EBV develop tumor vascular networks that correlate with tumor growth, which is different from endothelial-derived angiogenic vessels and is VEGF-independent. Mechanistically, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling cascade, which is partly mediated by LMP2A, is responsible for EBV-induced VM formation. Both xenografts and clinical samples of NPC and EBVaGC exhibit VM histologically, which are correlated with AKT and HIF-1α activation. Furthermore, although anti-VEGF monotherapy shows limited effects, potent synergistic antitumor activities are achieved by combination therapy with VEGF and HIF-1α-targeted agents. Our findings suggest that EBV creates plasticity in epithelial cells to express endothelial phenotype and provides a novel EBV-targeted antitumor strategy.",
Neoadjuvant immunotherapy for dMMR and pMMR colorectal cancers: therapeutic strategies and putative biomarkers of response,"Christopher J. M. Williams, Allyson M. Peddle, Pashtoon M. Kasi, Jenny F. Seligmann, Campbell S. Roxburgh, Gary W. Middleton, Sabine Tejpar",2024-09-24,"Approximately 15% of locally advanced colorectal cancers (CRC) have DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), resulting in high microsatellite instability and a high tumour mutational burden. These cancers are frequently sensitive to therapy with immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the metastatic setting. This sensitivity seems to be even more pronounced in locally advanced disease, and organ preservation has become a realistic aim in ongoing clinical trials involving patients with dMMR rectal cancer. By contrast, metastatic CRCs with proficient DNA mismatch repair (pMMR) are generally resistant to ICIs, although a proportion of locally advanced pMMR tumours seem to have a high degree of sensitivity to ICIs. In this Review, we describe the current and emerging clinical evidence supporting the use of neoadjuvant ICIs in patients with dMMR and pMMR CRC, and the potential advantages (based on a biological rationale) of such an approach. We discuss how neoadjuvant ‘window-of-opportunity’ trials are being leveraged to progress biomarker discovery and we provide an overview of potential predictive biomarkers of response to ICIs, exploring the challenges faced when evaluating such biomarkers in biopsy-derived samples. Lastly, we describe how these discoveries might be used to drive a rational approach to trialling novel immunotherapeutic strategies in patients with pMMR CRC, with the ultimate aim of disease eradication and the generation of long-term immunosurveillance.",

Intra-prostate heterogeneity was pervasive and impacted clinically relevant genes, resulting in discordant genotypes between select primary restricted regions and synchronous metastases. Additional complexity was driven by polyclonal metastatic seeding from phylogenetically related primary populations. When simulating clinical practice relying on a single tissue region, genomic heterogeneity plus variable tumor fraction across samples caused inaccurate genotyping of dominant disease; however, pooling extracted DNA from multiple biopsy cores before sequencing can rescue misassigned somatic genotypes.

The primary endpoint for Arms A/B - treatment-related change in IL17A expression in vaccine-induced lymphoid aggregates - was previously published. Here, we report the primary endpoint for Arms B/C: treatment-related change in intratumoral CD8+ CD137+ cells and the secondary outcomes including safety, disease-free and overall survivals for all Arms. Treatment with GVAX+nivolumab+urelumab meets the primary endpoint by significantly increasing intratumoral CD8+ CD137+ cells (p = 0.003) compared to GVAX+Nivolumab. All treatments are well-tolerated. Median disease-free and overall survivals, respectively, are 13.90/14.98/33.51 and 23.59/27.01/35.55 months for Arms A/B/C.

Kaufman",2022-04-07,"Natural killer (NK) cells are known to mediate killing of various cancer types, but tumor cells can develop resistance mechanisms to escape NK cell-mediated killing. Here, we use a “two cell type” whole genome CRISPR-Cas9 screening system to discover key regulators of tumor sensitivity and resistance to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSC). We identify CHMP2A as a regulator of GSC resistance to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and we confirm these findings in a head and neck squamous cells carcinoma (HNSCC) model. We show that deletion of CHMP2A activates NF-κB in tumor cells to mediate increased chemokine secretion that promotes NK cell migration towards tumor cells. In the HNSCC model we demonstrate that CHMP2A mediates tumor resistance to NK cells via secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that express MICA/B and TRAIL. These secreted ligands induce apoptosis of NK cells to inhibit their antitumor activity. To confirm these in vitro studies, we demonstrate that deletion of CHMP2A in CAL27 HNSCC cells leads to increased NK cell-mediated killing in a xenograft immunodeficient mouse model. These findings illustrate a mechanism of tumor immune escape through EVs secretion and identify inhibition of CHMP2A and related targets as opportunities to improve NK cell-mediated immunotherapy.",
Neutrophil-to-ferritin ratio can predict hematological causes of fever of unknown origin,"Hikmet Öztop, Fazıl Çağrı Hunutlu",2024-10-03,"Despite advancements in diagnostic modalities, delineating the etiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO) remains a significant challenge for clinicians. Notably, cases with hematological malignancies often have a poor prognosis due to delayed diagnosis. This study investigated the potential of readily obtainable laboratory markers to differentiate hematological causes from other etiologies during the early stages of FUO. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the medical records of 100 patients who fulfilled the modified FUO criteria between January 2010 and April 2023. Hematological etiologies were identified in 26 of the 100 patients. Peripheral blood neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet counts, and the systemic immune inflammation (SII) index, were significantly lower in the hematological group compared to the non-hematological group. Conversely, serum ferritin levels were demonstrably higher in the hematological group. ROC analysis identified a neutrophil-to-ferritin ratio (NFR) cutoff value of < 8.53 as optimal for predicting hematological etiology. Subsequent multivariate analysis demonstrated that the NFR was the sole independent predictor of hematological etiology (p = 0.013).This study proposes a novel approach for early diagnosis of a potentially life-threatening subset of FUO patients. The NFR presents as an inexpensive and readily available marker for predicting hematological etiology in FUO cases.","FUO, Lymphoma, Ferritin, Inflammation"

This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of POD24 in MM and risk factors of POD24, and to evaluate the predictive value of existing MM prognostic models for POD24. The research retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of MM patients and found that the occurrence of POD24 is an independent prognostic factor affecting overall survival in MM, while non-transplantion and genetic abnormality are independent risk factors for the occurrence of POD24. The existing prognostic models are not effective in predicting POD24. Therefore, it’s still necessary to explore a prognostic model that can predict POD24 more accurately.","Multiple myeloma, POD24, Prognostic analysis, Prognostic model, Prognostic factor"
Performance of an AI-powered visualization software platform for precision surgery in breast cancer patients,"Michelle Weitz, J. R.

Zamora, Stefanie Woodard",2024-11-14,"Surgery remains the primary treatment modality in the management of early-stage invasive breast cancer. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered visualization platforms offer the compelling potential to aid surgeons in evaluating the tumor’s location and morphology within the breast and accordingly optimize their surgical approach. We sought to validate an AI platform that employs dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to render three-dimensional (3D) representations of the tumor and 5 additional chest tissues, offering clear visualizations as well as functionalities for quantifying tumor morphology, tumor-to-landmark structure distances, excision volumes, and approximate surgical margins. This retrospective study assessed the visualization platform’s performance on 100 cases with ground-truth labels vetted by 2 breast-specialized radiologists. We assessed features including automatic AI-generated clinical metrics (e.g., tumor dimensions) as well as visualization tools including convex hulls at desired margins around the tumor to help visualize lumpectomy volume. The statistical performance of the platform’s automated features was robust and within the range of inter-radiologist variability. These detailed 3D tumor and surrounding multi-tissue depictions offer both qualitative and quantitative comprehension of cancer topology and may aid in formulating an optimal surgical approach for breast cancer treatment. We further establish the framework for broader data integration into the platform to enhance precision cancer care.",
MAX inactivation is an early event in GIST development that regulates p16 and cell proliferation,"Inga-Marie Schaefer, Yuexiang Wang, Cher-wei Liang, Nacef Bahri, Anna Quattrone, Leona Doyle, Adrian Mariño-Enríquez, Alexandra Lauria, Meijun Zhu, Maria Debiec-Rychter, Susanne Grunewald, Jaclyn F.

Raut, Sebastian Bauer, Jonathan A. Fletcher",2017-03-08,"KIT, PDGFRA, NF1 and SDH mutations are alternate initiating events, fostering hyperplasia in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), and additional genetic alterations are required for progression to malignancy. The most frequent secondary alteration, demonstrated in ∼70% of GISTs, is chromosome 14q deletion. Here we report hemizygous or homozygous inactivating mutations of the chromosome 14q MAX gene in 16 of 76 GISTs (21%). We find MAX mutations in 17% and 50% of sporadic and NF1-syndromic GISTs, respectively, and we find loss of MAX protein expression in 48% and 90% of sporadic and NF1-syndromic GISTs, respectively, and in three of eight micro-GISTs, which are early GISTs. MAX genomic inactivation is associated with p16 silencing in the absence of p16 coding sequence deletion and MAX induction restores p16 expression and inhibits GIST proliferation. Hence, MAX inactivation is a common event in GIST progression, fostering cell cycle activity in early GISTs.",

We use an approach that characterises rather than discards artefacts. We identify three artefactual signatures, including one known (SBS57) and two previously uncharacterised (SBS FFPE, ID FFPE), and develop an “FFPEImpact” score that quantifies sample artefacts. Despite inferior sequencing quality, FFPE-derived data identifies clinically-actionable variants, mutational signatures and permits algorithmic stratification. Matched FF/FFPE validation cohorts shows good concordance while acknowledging SBS, ID and copy-number artefacts. While FF-derived WGS data remains the gold standard, FFPE-samples can be used for WGS if required, using analytical advancements developed here, potentially democratising whole cancer genomics to many.",
Neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy with camrelizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and cisplatin in resectable locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: a pilot phase II trial,"Di Wu, Yong Li, Pengfei Xu, Qi Fang, Fei Cao, Hongsheng Lin, Yin Li, Yong Su, Lixia Lu, Lei Chen, Yizhuo Li, Zheng zhao, Xiaoyu Hong, Guohong Li, Yaru Tian, Jinyun Sun, Honghong Yan, Yunyun Fan, Xinrui Zhang, Zhiming Li, Xuekui Liu",2024-03-11,"Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy has emerged as a potential treatment option for resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In this single-arm phase II trial (NCT04826679), patients with resectable locally advanced HNSCC (T2‒T4, N0‒N3b, M0) received neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy with camrelizumab (200 mg), nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m2), and cisplatin (60 mg/m2) intravenously on day one of each three-week cycle for three cycles. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included pathologic complete response (pCR), major pathologic response (MPR), two-year progression-free survival rate, two-year overall survival rate, and toxicities. Here, we report the perioperative outcomes; survival outcomes were not mature at the time of data analysis. Between April 19, 2021 and March 17, 2022, 48 patients were enrolled and received neoadjuvant therapy, 27 of whom proceeded to surgical resection and remaining 21 received non-surgical therapy. The ORR was 89.6% (95% CI: 80.9, 98.2) among 48 patients who completed neoadjuvant therapy. Of the 27 patients who underwent surgery, 17 (63.0%, 95% CI: 44.7, 81.2) achieved a MPR or pCR, with a pCR rate of 55.6% (95% CI: 36.8, 74.3). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in two patients.

Foundation model for cancer imaging biomarkers,"Suraj Pai, Dennis Bontempi, Ibrahim Hadzic, Vasco Prudente, Mateo Sokač, Tafadzwa L. Chaunzwa, Simon Bernatz, Ahmed Hosny, Raymond H. Mak, Nicolai J. Birkbak, Hugo J. W. L. Aerts",2024-03-15,"Foundation models in deep learning are characterized by a single large-scale model trained on vast amounts of data serving as the foundation for various downstream tasks. Foundation models are generally trained using self-supervised learning and excel in reducing the demand for training samples in downstream applications. This is especially important in medicine, where large labelled datasets are often scarce. Here, we developed a foundation model for cancer imaging biomarker discovery by training a convolutional encoder through self-supervised learning using a comprehensive dataset of 11,467 radiographic lesions. The foundation model was evaluated in distinct and clinically relevant applications of cancer imaging-based biomarkers. We found that it facilitated better and more efficient learning of imaging biomarkers and yielded task-specific models that significantly outperformed conventional supervised and other state-of-the-art pretrained implementations on downstream tasks, especially when training dataset sizes were very limited. Furthermore, the foundation model was more stable to input variations and showed strong associations with underlying biology. Our results demonstrate the tremendous potential of foundation models in discovering new imaging biomarkers that may extend to other clinical use cases and can accelerate the widespread translation of imaging biomarkers into clinical settings.",

Here, we present the final, long-term efficacy (secondary endpoints: event-free survival, disease-free survival, overall survival) and safety analysis (62.9 months’ median follow-up). Patients (female; n = 329; randomized 2:1) received neoadjuvant pertuzumab/placebo with trastuzumab and docetaxel, followed by adjuvant 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide, then pertuzumab/placebo with trastuzumab until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity, for up to 1 year. Five-year event-free survival estimates are 84.8% with pertuzumab and 73.7% with placebo (hazard ratio 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.32–0.89); 5-year disease-free survival rates are 86.0% and 75.0%, respectively (hazard ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval 0.30–0.88). Safety data are consistent with the known pertuzumab safety profile and generally comparable between arms, except for diarrhea. Limitations include the lack of ado-trastuzumab emtansine as an option for patients with residual disease and the descriptive nature of the secondary, long-term efficacy endpoints.

Outcome differences by sex in oncology clinical trials,"Ashwin V. Kammula, Alejandro A. Schäffer, Padma Sheila Rajagopal, Razelle Kurzrock, Eytan Ruppin",2024-03-23,"Identifying sex differences in outcomes and toxicity between males and females in oncology clinical trials is important and has also been mandated by National Institutes of Health policies. Here we analyze the Trialtrove database, finding that, strikingly, only 472/89,221 oncology clinical trials (0.5%) had curated post-treatment sex comparisons. Among 288 trials with comparisons of survival, outcome, or response, 16% report males having statistically significant better survival outcome or response, while 42% reported significantly better survival outcome or response for females. The strongest differences are in trials of EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer and rituximab in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (both favoring females). Among 44 trials with side effect comparisons, more trials report significantly lesser side effects in males (N = 22) than in females (N = 13). Thus, while statistical comparisons between sexes in oncology trials are rarely reported, important differences in outcome and toxicity exist. These considerable outcome and toxicity differences highlight the need for reporting sex differences more thoroughly going forward.",

Targeting membranous phosphatidylserine may induce pro-inflammatory and -immune stimulating effects that enhance immunotherapy activity. This hypothesis was tested in a single-arm phase 2 trial evaluating frontline bavituximab, a phosphatidylserine targeting antibody, plus pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT03519997). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate among evaluable patients, and secondary end points included progression-free survival, incidence of adverse events, overall survival, and duration of response. Among 28 evaluable patients, the confirmed response rate was 32.1%, which met the pre-specified endpoint, and the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (95% CI, 1.3–11.3 months). Treatment related-adverse events of any grade occurred in 45.7% of patients, with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 14.3% of patients. Adverse events of any cause were observed in 33 patients (94.3%), with grade 3 or greater adverse events in 11 patients (31.4%). Prespecified exploratory analyses of baseline tumor specimens showed that a depletion of B cells, and the presence of fibrotic tissue and expression of immune checkpoints in stroma was associated with tumor response. These results suggest that targeting phosphatidylserine may lead to synergistic effects with PD-1 blockade without increasing toxicity rates, and future studies on this therapeutic strategy may be guided by biomarkers characterizing the pre-treatment tumor microenvironment.",
Prognostic significance of pretreatment albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade and platelet–albumin–bilirubin (PALBI) grade in patients with small cell lung cancer,"Engin Kut, Serkan Menekse",2024-01-16,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a common cancer among the world’s lung cancers. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis is still poor. There is no effective biomarker other than stage in daily practice. However, in daily practice, patients may have different features and survival times even though they have the same stage. Previously, albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) grade, platelet–albumin–bilirubin (PALBI) grade were used to determine the prognosis of acute-chronic liver failure and acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in liver cirrhosis. In subsequent studies, they were found to be associated with prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other solid cancers. However, the prognostic relationship between ALBI grade, PALBI grade, and SCLC is unknown. Therefore, we conducted this study to examine the relationship between ALBI grade and PALBI grade and prognosis in SCLC patients. Data of 138 patients with advanced SCLC at diagnosis between 2009 and 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The results of the multivariate analysis were as follows: ALBI grade 1 vs 2, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.608, p = 0.002 for OS and HR = 1.575, p = 0.002 for PFS; ALBI grade 1 vs 3, HR = 2.035, p < 0.001 for OS and HR = 2.675, p < 0.001 for PFS; PALBI grade 1 vs 2, HR = 1.302, p = 0.006 for OS and HR = 1.674, p = 0.002 for PFS; and PALBI grade 1 vs 3, HR = 1.725, p < 0.001 for OS and HR = 2.675, p < 0.001 for PFS. In conclusion, the ALBI and PALBI grades were determined to be associated with the prognosis of SCLC, and they can be used as easy, inexpensive, and practical markers in determining the follow-up treatment and prognosis of SCLC patients.",

Primary endpoints were the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and RP2D of trotabresib. Secondary endpoints were clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + stable disease [SD] of ≥4 months’ duration), objective response rate (CR + PR), duration of response or SD, progression-free survival, overall survival, and the pharmacokinetics (PK) of trotabresib. In addition, part C assessed the effects of food on the PK of trotabresib as a secondary endpoint. The dose escalation (part A) showed that trotabresib was well tolerated, had single-agent activity, and determined the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule for the expansion study. Here, we report long-term follow-up results from part A (N = 69) and data from patients treated with the RP2D of 45 mg/day 4 days on/24 days off or an alternate RP2D of 30 mg/day 3 days on/11 days off in the dose-expansion cohorts (parts B [N = 25] and C [N = 41]). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) are reported in almost all patients. The most common severe TRAEs are hematological. Toxicities are generally manageable, allowing some patients to remain on treatment for ≥2 years, with two patients receiving ≥3 years of treatment.

In the UK, despite Black men having vastly different ancestral contexts and health-care systems from Black men in the USA, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is two-to-three times higher among Black British men than among white British men and Black British men are twice as likely to die of prostate cancer as white British men. Examination of racial disparities in prostate cancer in the USA and UK highlights systemic, socio-economic and sociocultural factors that might contribute to these differences. Variation by ancestry could affect incidence and tumour genomics. Disparities in incidence might also be affected by screening guidelines and access to and uptake of screening. Disparities in treatment access, continuity of care and outcomes could contribute to survival differences. In both localized and metastatic settings, equal access could diminish the observed disparities in both the USA and the UK. An understanding of behavioural medicine, especially an appreciation of cultural beliefs about illness and treatment, could inform and improve the ways in which health systems can engage with and deliver care to patients in minoritized groups affected by prostate cancer. Methods of promoting equity include targeting systemic barriers including systemic racism, proportional recruitment of patients into clinical trials, diversifying the health-care workforce and facilitating care informed by cultural humility. Actively engaging patients and communities in research and intervention might enable the translation of research into increasingly equitable care for patients with prostate cancer in the UK, the USA and globally.",

We performed multiomic single cell profiling of 14 newly diagnosed adult MPAL patients to characterize the inter- and intra-tumoral transcriptional, immunophenotypic, and genetic landscapes of MPAL. We show that neither genetic profile nor transcriptome reliably correlate with specific MPAL immunophenotypes. Despite this, we find that MPAL blasts express a shared stem cell-like transcriptional profile indicative of high differentiation potential. Patients with the highest differentiation potential demonstrate inferior survival in our dataset. A gene set score, MPAL95, derived from genes highly enriched in the most stem-like MPAL cells, is applicable to bulk RNA sequencing data and is predictive of survival in an independent patient cohort, suggesting a potential strategy for clinical risk stratification.",

From July 2017 to July 2020, 787 treatment-naïve HCC patients underwent initial treatment; 77 (9.8%) meeting inclusion criteria were enrolled. Their initial treatments were TACE only (n = 68, 88.3%) or TACE with other treatments (n = 9, 11.7%). Median survival of the TACE-only group was 30 months. Treatment response was evaluated after 2 or 3 consecutive TACEs for patients (54/68, 79.4%) with available pre-/post-TACE computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment responses was divided into 4 groups: complete (n = 14, 26%, group (Gr) 1), incomplete without new tumor growth (n = 28, 52.0%, Gr2), incomplete with new growth (n = 6, 11%, Gr3), and progression (n = 6, 11%, Gr4). Of Gr2, further treatment after TACE were had radiofrequency ablation (n = 13, Gr2a), TACE (n = 9, Gr2b), other modalities (n = 6, Gr2c. Gr2a’s median survival was longer than Gr2b’s (> 60 vs. 20 months, p = 0.007). Nine patients in Gr2a (69%, 9/13) achieved a complete response, but none in Gr2b (p = 0.001). Conclusively, in TACE-suitable BCLC stage B HCC patients, a partial response without new tumor growth can serve as an indicator of treatment effectiveness following initial TACE treatment. This can facilitate the selection of appropriate candidates to receive RFA, potentially resulting in improved patient survival.","Hepatocellular carcinoma, TACE, Incomplete response, New tumor growth"

We have shown previously that lenvatinib and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) combination therapy overcomes lenvatinib resistance in HCC with high level of EGFR expression (EGFRhigh). We present here the results of a single-arm, open-label, exploratory study of lenvatinib plus the EGFR-TKI gefitinib for patients with HCC resistance to lenvatinib (NCT04642547; n = 30). Only patients with EGFRhigh HCC and progressive disease after lenvatinib treatment were recruited in the study. The most frequent adverse events of all grades were fatigue (27 patients; 90%), followed by rash (25 patients; 83.3%), diarrhea (24 patients; 80%), and anorexia (12 patients; 40%). Among 30 patients, 9 (30%) achieved a confirmed partial response and 14 (46.7%) had stable disease according to mRECIST criteria.

Genome-wide identification and analysis of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related RNA-binding proteins and alternative splicing in a human breast cancer cell line,"Yin Mi, Meilian Dong, Xiaoxiao Zuo, Qinchen Cao, Xiaobin Gu, Hailong Mi, Fankai Xiao",2024-05-23,"Exploring the mechanism of breast cancer metastasis and searching for new drug therapeutic targets are still the focuses of current research. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) may affect breast cancer metastasis by regulating alternative splicing (AS) during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We hypothesised that during EMT development in breast cancer cells, the expression level of RBPs and the gene AS pattern in the cell were significantly changed on a genome-wide scale. Using GEO database, this study identified differentially expressed RBPs and differential AS events at different stages of EMT in breast cancer cells. By establishing the correlation network of differential RBPs and differential AS events, we found that RBM47, PCBP3, FRG1, SRP72, RBMS3 and other RBPs may regulate the AS of ITGA6, ADGRE5, TNC, COL6A3 and other cell adhesion genes. By further analysing above EMT-related RBPs and AS in breast cancer tissues in TCGA, it was found that the expression levels of ADAT2, C2orf15, SRP72, PAICS, RBMS3, APOBEC3G, NOA1, ACO1 and the AS of TNC and COL6A3 were significantly correlated with the prognosis of breast cancer patients. The expression levels of all 8 RBPs were significantly different in breast cancer tissues without metastasis compared with normal breast tissues. Conclusively, eight RBPs such as RBMS3 and AS of TNC and COL6A3 could be used as predictors of breast cancer prognosis. These findings need to be further explored as possible targets for breast cancer treatment.","Alternative splicing, Breast cancer, Cell adhesion, Epithelial-mesenchymal transition, Immune escape"
Association between depression and liver function biomarkers among US cancer survivors in NHANES 2005–2020,"Yanlong Li, Zhikang Ye, Xingyu Ran, Jintian Luo, Hui Li, Peng Zhou, Si Shen, Jing Li",2024-11-11,"Depression frequently comorbidities with cancer, adversely affecting survivors’ quality of life. Liver dysfunction is also prevalent among cancer survivors. However, the association between these two conditions remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between depression and liver function biomarkers in US cancer survivors. A cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2020. Cancer survivors were screened and depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and 18 liver function biomarkers were included. Survey-weighted generalized linear models with multiple covariables adjusted were employed to examine the associations between depression and liver function biomarkers. A total of 4118 cancer survivors were included, representing a weighted population of 21 501 237. After adjusted with age, gender, race, marital status, education level, family income-to-poverty ratio, and number of cancer types, 8 biomarkers demonstrated positive correlations with depression in cancer survivors, included alanine aminotransferase (ALT, OR = 1.007, 95% CI: 1.000 to 1.013), alkaline phosphatase (ALP, 1.006 [1.002, 1.010]), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT, 1.004 [1.001, 1.007]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 1.004 [1.000, 1.009]), total protein (TP, 1.040 [1.009, 1.072]), globulin (GLB, 1.060 [1.030, 1.091]), total cholesterol (TC) to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (1.162 [1.050, 1.286]), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to HDL-C ratio (1.243 [1.012, 1.526]); while 4 other biomarkers exhibited negative correlations, included HDL-C (0.988 [0.980, 0.997]), total bilirubin (TBi, 0.501 [0.284, 0.883]), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to ALT ratio (0.588 [0.351, 0.986]), albumin (ALB) to GLB ratio (0.384 [0.229, 0.642]). Following sensitivity analysis, 5 biomarkers included LDH, HDL-C, TBi, AST/ALT and LDL-C/HDL-C lost their statistical significance for the association. This study identified certain associations between 7 liver function biomarkers and depression in US cancer survivors. Further research, particularly prospective longitudinal studies, is warranted to elucidate the causal relationships and explore the potential of improving liver function for the management of depression in cancer patients.","Depression, Liver function biomarker, Cancer survivor, Cross-sectional study, NHANES, Psycho-oncology"
TBI/Cy followed by auto-HSCT is a good choice next to allo-HSCT for patients with T-LBL/ALL,"Jinghua Mao, Jurui Ge, Shiqi Ding, Zhenchang Sun, Feifei Nan, Hui Yu, Jiayin Ding, Xinyi Wang, Zhuling Liu, Mingzhi Zhang, Xiaorui Fu",2024-09-27,"The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficiency and safety of total body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide (TBI/Cy) followed by autogenetic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) in T-LBL/ALL patients that cannot receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT). Between 2013 and 2023, 24 patients received auto-HSCT following by TBI/Cy, 26 patients underwent allo-HSCT, all patients achieved completed hematopoietic reconstitution after HSCT. The progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) had no statistically significant differences between the two groups (P = 0.791, HR 1.127, 95%CI 0.456–2.785; P = 0.456, HR 0.685, 95%CI 0.256–1.828). Although the cumulative incidence of relapse was lower for patients who received allo-HSCT than auto-HSCT (P = 0.033, HR 3.707, 95%CI 1.188–11.570, 2-year relapse 11.5% vs. 33.3%), the incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) was higher than that in the auto-HSCT group (P = 0.014, HR 0.000, 95%CI -1.000 - -1.000, 2-year NRM, 23.1% vs. 0%). Trough Landmark analysis, the two groups showed a statistically significant difference in 3-year PFS and 4-year OS curves (Figure S2A&B, P = 0.039, HR 0.426, 95%CI 0.163–1.117; P = 0.014, HR 0.317, 95%CI 0.113–0.887). By COX analysis, poor baseline performance status (ECOG-PS ≥ 2) and CNS involvement were risk factors for PFS and OS. In conclusion, TBI/Cy followed by auto-HSCT is a good choice next to allo-HSCT for patients with T-LBL/ALL.","T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/Leukemia, Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, Autogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, Total body irradiation"
Development of a decision tree model for predicting the malignancy of localized gingival enlargements based on clinical characteristics,"Pawat Sripodok, Puangwan Lapthanasupkul, Tawepong Arayapisit, Nakarin Kitkumthorn, Natchalee Srimaneekarn, Vichaya Neeranadpuree, Watjanee Amornwatcharapong, Supawit Hempornwisarn, Sirikorn Amornwikaikul, Dulyapong Rungraungrayabkul",2024-09-27,"The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of localized gingival enlargements (LGEs) and their clinical characteristics in a group of Thai patients, as well as utilize this information to develop a clinical diagnostic guide for predicting malignant LGEs. All LGE cases were retrospectively reviewed during a 20-year period. Clinical diagnoses, pathological diagnoses, patient demographic data, and clinical information were analyzed. The prevalence of LGEs was determined and categorized based on their nature, and concordance rates between clinical and pathological diagnoses among the groups were evaluated. Finally, a diagnostic guide was developed using clinical information through a decision tree model. Of 14,487 biopsied cases, 946 cases (6.53%) were identified as LGEs. The majority of LGEs were reactive lesions (72.62%), while a small subset was malignant tumors (7.51%). Diagnostic concordance rates were lower in malignant LGEs (54.93%) compared to non-malignant LGEs (80.69%). Size, consistency, color, duration, and patient age were identified as pivotal factors to formulate a clinical diagnostic guide for distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant LGEs. Using a decision tree model, we propose a novel diagnostic guide to assist clinicians in enhancing the accuracy of clinical differentiation between malignant and non-malignant LGEs.","Localized gingival enlargement, Gingival cancer, Cancer, Reactive lesion, Diagnostic tree, Decision tree model"
An artificial intelligence framework integrating longitudinal electronic health records with real-world data enables continuous pan-cancer prognostication,"Olivier Morin, Martin Vallières, Steve Braunstein, Jorge Barrios Ginart, Taman Upadhaya, Henry C.

Here, we develop MEDomics, a continuously learning infrastructure through which multimodal health data are systematically organized and data quality is assessed with the goal of applying artificial intelligence for individual prognosis. Using this framework, currently composed of thousands of individuals with cancer and millions of data points over a decade of data recording, we demonstrate prognostic utility of this framework in oncology. As proof of concept, we report an analysis using this infrastructure, which identified the Framingham risk score to be robustly associated with mortality among individuals with early-stage and advanced-stage cancer, a potentially actionable finding from a real-world cohort of individuals with cancer. Finally, we show how natural language processing (NLP) of medical notes could be used to continuously update estimates of prognosis as a given individual’s disease course unfolds.",
Thyroid fine needle aspiration specimen adequacy: a noninferiority study and cost-effectiveness comparison of puncture needles,"Pengfei Luo, Wei Ma, Dahai Jiao",2024-09-29,"Needle selection plays a pivotal role in determining the success of fine needle aspiration (FNA) procedures. Two commonly utilized puncture needles for thyroid FNA are the conventional syringe needle and the stylet needle. Syringe needles are known for their cost-effectiveness in comparison to stylet needles. This study aimed to determine if FNA with syringe needles is non-inferior to FNA with stylet needles in terms of specimen adequacy while also comparing the direct costs associated with both needle types. A total of 220 thyroid nodules from 185 patients were prospectively included in this study. The same operator performed a total of four punctures on the same nodule twice using a syringe and a stylet needle. The results of this study show that the utilization of syringe needles for thyroid FNA was non-inferior to the use of stylet needles in terms of specimen adequacy. Cost analysis revealed that syringe needle FNA was not only less expensive (CNY 500.9 versus CNY 780) but also more effective (adequacy 85.91% versus 84.55%). In summary, given the global prevalence of FNA procedures, the economic considerations are paramount, and our findings support the routine use of syringe needles in thyroid FNA.",
An elevated rate of whole-genome duplications in cancers from Black patients,"Leanne M. Brown, Ryan A. Hagenson, Tilen Koklič, Iztok Urbančič, Lu Qiao, Janez Strancar, Jason M. Sheltzer",2024-09-19,"In the United States, Black individuals have higher rates of cancer mortality than any other racial group. Here, we examine chromosome copy number changes in cancers from more than 1800 self-reported Black patients. We find that tumors from self-reported Black patients are significantly more likely to exhibit whole-genome duplications (WGDs), a genomic event that enhances metastasis and aggressive disease, compared to tumors from self-reported white patients. This increase in WGD frequency is observed across multiple cancer types, including breast, endometrial, and lung cancer, and is associated with shorter patient survival. We further demonstrate that combustion byproducts are capable of inducing WGDs in cell culture, and cancers from self-reported Black patients exhibit mutational signatures consistent with exposure to these carcinogens. In total, these findings identify a type of genomic alteration that is associated with environmental exposures and that may influence racial disparities in cancer outcomes.",
The impact of family cancer history on tumor metabolism and prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer,"Mengtian Ma, Hongpei Tan, Haixiong Yan, Kai Zheng",2024-09-30,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, and the role of family cancer history in disease progression and treatment response remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the influence of family tumor history on disease-free survival, tumor metabolism, and treatment response in NSCLC patients. A retrospective, single-center study of 414 NSCLC patients was conducted, with 101 patients having a family history of cancer (FHC). Disease-free survival (DFS), tumor glucose metabolism assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT, and treatment response to chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy were analyzed. Multivariate modeling was performed to improve prognostic prediction. Patients with FHC exhibited higher TNM staging, increased susceptibility to lymph node invasion, and elevated tumor glucose metabolism levels. Family history of cancer, particularly colorectal and lung cancer, was a significant risk factor for disease-free survival. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy significantly improved patient prognosis, while family history of cancer affected the efficacy of chemoradiotherapy but not targeted therapy or immunotherapy. Multivariate modeling combining FHC, treatment, and tumor metabolism levels yielded improved predictive performance. Our study highlights the importance of considering a patient’s family history when assessing risk profiles and formulating treatment decisions for NSCLC patients. Further research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these observed associations and to develop more effective treatment strategies for NSCLC patients with a cancer family history.","NSCLC, Prognosis, Disease-free survival (DFS), 18F-FDG PET/CT, Family history of cancer (FHC)"
"Bevacizumab, olaparib, and durvalumab in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer: a phase II clinical trial from the GINECO group","Gilles Freyer, Anne Floquet, Olivier Tredan, Aurore Carrot, Carole Langlois-Jacques, Jonathan Lopez, Frédéric Selle, Cyril Abdeddaim, Alexandra Leary, Coraline Dubot-Poitelon, Michel Fabbro, Laurence Gladieff, Michele Lamuraglia",2024-03-05,"Most patients with advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) ultimately relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy. Combining bevacizumab, olaparib, and durvalumab likely drives synergistic activity. This open-label phase 2 study (NCT04015739) aimed to assess activity and safety of this triple combination in female patients with relapsed high-grade AOC following prior platinum-based therapy. Patients were treated with olaparib (300 mg orally, twice daily), the bevacizumab biosimilar FKB238 (15 mg/kg intravenously, once-every-3-weeks), and durvalumab (1.12 g intravenously, once-every-3-weeks) in nine French centers. The primary endpoint was the non-progression rate at 3 months for platinum-resistant relapse or 6 months for platinum-sensitive relapse per RECIST 1.1 and irRECIST. Secondary endpoints were CA-125 decline with CA-125 ELIMination rate constant K (KELIM-B) per CA-125 longitudinal kinetics over 100 days, progression free survival and overall survival, tumor response, and safety. Non-progression rates were 69.8% (90%CI 55.9%-80.0%) at 3 months for platinum-resistant relapse patients (N = 41), meeting the prespecified endpoint, and 43.8% (90%CI 29.0%-57.4%) at 6 months for platinum-sensitive relapse (N = 33), not meeting the prespecified endpoint. Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95%CI 3.5–5.9) and 4.9 months (95%CI 2.9–7.0) respectively. Favorable KELIM-B was associated with better survival. No toxic deaths or major safety signals were observed. Here we show that further investigation of this triple combination may be considered in AOC patients with platinum-resistant relapse.",

The primary endpoint is progression free-survival (PFS) rate at 12 months, and secondary endpoints include: feasibility of alternating therapy, overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and safety. The 12-month PFS rate is 38% (95% CI 27.5–55), not meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. Serial circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis reveals decrease and clearance of the original activating EGFR and EGFR-T790M mutations which are prognostic of clinical outcomes. In 73% of participants, loss of T790M ctDNA is observed at progression and no participants have evidence of the EGFR C797S resistance mutation following the alternating regimen. These findings highlight the challenges of treatment strategies designed to modulate clonal evolution and the clinical importance of resistance mechanisms beyond suppression of selected genetic mutations in driving therapeutic escape to highly potent targeted therapies.",

Here, we use a large, high-quality retrospective mammography dataset from Victoria, Australia to conduct detailed simulations of five potential AI-integrated screening pathways, and examine human-AI interaction effects to explore automation bias. Operating an AI reader as a second reader or as a high confidence filter improves current screening outcomes by 1.9–2.5% in sensitivity and up to 0.6% in specificity, achieving 4.6–10.9% reduction in assessments and 48–80.7% reduction in human reads. Automation bias degrades performance in multi-reader settings but improves it for single-readers.

However, little is known about the precise function and consequences of PHF6 in MN. Here we show three main findings in our comprehensive genomic and proteomic study. Firstly, we show a different pattern of genes correlating with PHF6MT in male and female cases. When analyzing male and female cases separately, in only male cases, RUNX1 and U2AF1 are co-mutated with PHF6. In contrast, female cases reveal co-occurrence of ASXL1 mutations and X-chromosome deletions with PHF6MT. Next, proteomics analysis reveals a direct interaction between PHF6 and RUNX1. Both proteins co-localize in active enhancer regions that define the context of lineage differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate a negative prognostic role of PHF6MT, especially in association with RUNX1. The negative effects on survival are additive as PHF6MT cases with RUNX1 mutations have worse outcomes when compared to cases carrying single mutation or wild-type.",

To comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of inflamed CRC, we perform in vivo screening and identify 142 genes that are frequently mutated in inflammation-associated colon tumors. These genes include senescence and TGFβ-activin signaling genes. We find that TNFα can induce stemness and activate senescence signaling by enhancing cell plasticity in colonic epithelial cells, which could act as a selective pressure to mutate senescence-related genes in inflammation-associated colonic tumors. Furthermore, we show the efficacy of the Cdk4/6 inhibitor in vivo for inflammation-associated colonic tumors. Finally, we functionally validate that Arhgap5 and Mecom are tumor suppressor genes, providing possible therapeutic targets for CRC. Thus, we demonstrate the importance of the inactivation of senescence pathways in CRC development and progression in an inflammatory microenvironment, which can help progress toward precision medicine.",

High abundance of locally-aggregated inflammatory cells indicates immune-activated tumor microenvironment and favorable immunotherapy response in triple-negative breast cancers. Morphological intratumor heterogeneity of tumor nuclei correlates with cell cycle pathway activation and CDK inhibitors responsiveness in hormone receptor-positive cases. sc-MTOP enables using WSIs to characterize tumor ecosystems at the single-cell level.",
Comprehensive analysis of risk factors for flap necrosis in free flap reconstruction of postoperative tissue defects in oral and maxillofacial tumors,"Shao-bo Ouyang, Zhi-hong Wu, Yan-ping Zhang, Xiao-li Lu",2024-08-12,"Free flap reconstruction for postoperative tissue defects in oral and maxillofacial tumors is a critical component of reconstructive surgery. Identifying risk factors for flap necrosis is essential for improving surgical outcomes and patient quality of life. A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent free flap reconstruction between January 2020 and December 2023. Patients were included if they had comprehensive medical records and at least a six-month follow-up. We excluded those with a history of flap necrosis, uncontrolled systemic diseases, non-adherence to postoperative care, or concurrent malignancy treatments. Data on demographics, comorbidities, flap characteristics, and operative details were collected and analyzed using univariate analysis and logistic regression tests. Univariate analysis did not find a significant correlation between flap necrosis and factors such as hyperlipidemia, lymph node metastasis, or flap type. However, diabetes mellitus, oral infections, and albumin levels below 35 g/L were significantly associated with flap necrosis. Multivariate logistic regression showed diabetes mellitus increased the odds of flap necrosis by approximately ninefold, and oral infection increased it by over tenfold. Diabetes mellitus, oral infection, and low albumin levels are significant risk factors for flap necrosis in free flap reconstruction after oral and maxillofacial surgery. Prompt identification and management of these factors are crucial to mitigate the risk of flap necrosis.","Flap necrosis, Tissue defects, Free flap reconstruction, Oral and maxillofacial surgery"
Development of mesothelioma-specific oncolytic immunotherapy enabled by immunopeptidomics of murine and human mesothelioma tumors,"Jacopo Chiaro, Gabriella Antignani, Sara Feola, Michaela Feodoroff, Beatriz Martins, Hanne Cojoc, Salvatore Russo, Manlio Fusciello, Firas Hamdan, Valentina Ferrari, Daniele Ciampi, Ilkka Ilonen, Jari Räsänen, Mikko Mäyränpää, Jukka Partanen, Satu Koskela, Jarno Honkanen, Jussi Halonen, Lukasz Kuryk, Maria Rescigno, Mikaela Grönholm, Rui M. Branca, Janne Lehtiö, Vincenzo Cerullo",2023-11-03,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis. As the available therapeutic options show a lack of efficacy, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Given its T-cell infiltration, we hypothesized that MPM is a suitable target for therapeutic cancer vaccination. To date, research on mesothelioma has focused on the identification of molecular signatures to better classify and characterize the disease, and little is known about therapeutic targets that engage cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells. In this study we investigate the immunopeptidomic antigen-presented landscape of MPM in both murine (AB12 cell line) and human cell lines (H28, MSTO-211H, H2452, and JL1), as well as in patients’ primary tumors. Applying state-of-the-art immuno-affinity purification methodologies, we identify MHC I-restricted peptides presented on the surface of malignant cells. We characterize in vitro the immunogenicity profile of the eluted peptides using T cells from human healthy donors and cancer patients. Furthermore, we use the most promising peptides to formulate an oncolytic virus-based precision immunotherapy (PeptiCRAd) and test its efficacy in a mouse model of mesothelioma in female mice. Overall, we demonstrate that the use of immunopeptidomic analysis in combination with oncolytic immunotherapy represents a feasible and effective strategy to tackle untreatable tumors.",
Adrenergic stress constrains the development of anti-tumor immunity and abscopal responses following local radiation,"Minhui Chen, Guanxi Qiao, Bonnie L. Hylander, Hemn Mohammadpour, Xiang-Yang Wang, John R. Subjeck, Anurag K. Singh, Elizabeth A. Repasky",2020-04-14,"The abscopal effect following ionizing radiation therapy (RT) is considered to be a rare event. This effect does occur more frequently when combined with other therapies, including immunotherapy. Here we demonstrate that the frequency of abscopal events following RT alone is highly dependent upon the degree of adrenergic stress in the tumor-bearing host. Using a combination of physiologic, pharmacologic and genetic strategies, we observe improvements in the control of both irradiated and non-irradiated distant tumors, including metastatic tumors, when adrenergic stress or signaling through β-adrenergic receptor is reduced. Further, we observe cellular and molecular evidence of improved, antigen-specific, anti-tumor immune responses which also depend upon T cell egress from draining lymph nodes. These data suggest that blockade of β2 adrenergic stress signaling could be a useful, safe, and feasible strategy to improve efficacy in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.",
"HSD3B1, prostate cancer mortality and modifiable outcomes","Pedro F. S. Freitas, Alireza Abdshah, Rana R. McKay, Nima Sharifi",2024-11-14,"Androgen receptor stimulation by testosterone and dihydrotestosterone is crucial for prostate cancer progression. Despite the initial effectiveness of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), castration-resistant prostate cancer eventually develops in most men. A common germline missense-encoding polymorphism in HSD3B1 increases extra-gonadal androgen biosynthesis from adrenal precursors owing to increased availability of the encoded enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (3βHSD1) — hence, it is called the adrenal-permissive enzyme. This mechanism explains the more rapid progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer in men who inherit this allele than in men without it via sustained androgen receptor activation despite ADT. Multiple clinical studies, including data derived from prospective phase III studies, have linked adrenal-permissive allele inheritance to inferior clinical responses to ADT and increased mortality, but reversal is possible with upfront adrenal androgen blockade. The adrenal-permissive allele exhibits divergent frequencies across various groups worldwide, which could contribute to differences in clinical outcomes among these populations. Large-scale data from the Million Veteran Program have shown homozygous HSD3B1 adrenal-permissive allele inheritance to be an independent biomarker of prostate cancer-specific mortality. Together, these observations support the integration of HSD3B1 into germline testing and clinical trials as it might help to identify groups at increased likelihood of benefiting from early, intensified, AR-targeting interventions. Lastly, 3βHSD1 is a promising target for pharmacological inhibition, which enables new strategies for systemic prostate cancer therapy.",

We subjected mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood and bone marrow before and after the application of approved B cell maturation antigen-directed CAR T cells to single-cell multiomic analyses to identify markers associated with resistance and early relapse. Differences between responders and nonresponders were identified at the time of leukapheresis. Nonresponders showed an immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by increased numbers of monocytes expressing the immune checkpoint molecule CD39 and suppressed CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell function. Analysis of CAR T cells showed cytotoxic and exhausted phenotypes in hyperexpanded clones compared to low/intermediate expanded clones. We identified potential immunotherapy targets on CAR T cells, like PD1, to improve their functionality and durability. Our work provides evidence that an immunosuppressive microenvironment causes resistance to CAR T cell therapies in multiple myeloma.",
Multimodal analysis of cfDNA methylomes for early detecting esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and precancerous lesions,"Jiaqi Liu, Lijun Dai, Qiang Wang, Chenghao Li, Zhichao Liu, Tongyang Gong, Hengyi Xu, Ziqi Jia, Wanyuan Sun, Xinyu Wang, Minyi Lu, Tongxuan Shang, Ning Zhao, Jiahui Cai, Zhigang Li, Hongyan Chen, Jianzhong Su, Zhihua Liu",2024-05-02,"Detecting early-stage esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and precancerous lesions is critical for improving survival. Here, we conduct whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on 460 cfDNA samples from patients with non-metastatic ESCC or precancerous lesions and matched healthy controls. We develop an expanded multimodal analysis (EMMA) framework to simultaneously identify cfDNA methylation, copy number variants (CNVs), and fragmentation markers in cfDNA WGBS data. cfDNA methylation markers are the earliest and most sensitive, detectable in 70% of ESCCs and 50% of precancerous lesions, and associated with molecular subtypes and tumor microenvironments. CNVs and fragmentation features show high specificity but are linked to late-stage disease. EMMA significantly improves detection rates, increasing AUCs from 0.90 to 0.99, and detects 87% of ESCCs and 62% of precancerous lesions with >95% specificity in validation cohorts. Our findings demonstrate the potential of multimodal analysis of cfDNA methylome for early detection and monitoring of molecular characteristics in ESCC.",

Here we report the results of a phase Ib/II study of guadecitabine and durvalumab in advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC; NCT03308396). Patients received guadecitabine (starting at 60 mg/m2 subcutaneously on days 1-5 with de-escalation to 45 mg/m2 in case of dose limiting toxicity) with durvalumab (1500 mg intravenously on day 8). The study enrolled 57 patients, 6 in phase Ib with safety being the primary objective and 51in phase II, comprising 2 cohorts: 36 patients in Cohort 1 were treatment naive to checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) with 0-1 prior therapies and 15 patients in Cohort 2 were treated with up to two prior systemic therapies including one CPI. The combination of guadecitabine 45 mg/m2 with durvalumab 1500 mg was deemed safe. The primary objective of overall response rate (ORR) in cohort 1 was 22%. Sixteen patients (44%) experienced stable disease (SD). Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), clinical benefit rate, and safety as well as ORR for Cohort 2. Median PFS for cohort 1 and cohort 2 were 14.26 and 3.91 months respectively. Median OS was not reached. In cohort 2, one patient achieved a partial response and 60% achieved SD. Asymptomatic neutropenia was the most common adverse event. Even though the trial did not meet the primary objective in cohort 1, the tolerability and PFS signal in CPI naive patients are worth further investigation.",

Although immune checkpoint therapies have achieved breakthroughs for treating recurrent and metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, none of these strategies have been assessed for treating residual nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In this single-arm, phase 2 trial, we aimed to evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety of toripalimab (anti-PD1 antibody) plus capecitabine in patients with residual nasopharyngeal carcinoma after definitive treatment (ChiCTR1900023710). Primary endpoint of this trial was the objective response rate assessed according to RECIST (version 1.1). Secondary endpoints included complete response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, progression-free survival, safety profile, and treatment compliance. Between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, 23 patients were recruited and received six cycles of toripalimab plus capecitabine every 3 weeks. In efficacy analyses, 13 patients (56.5%) had complete response, and 9 patients (39.1%) had partial response, with an objective response rate of 95.7% (95% CI 78.1-99.9). The trial met its prespecified primary endpoint. In safety analyses, 21 of (91.3%) 23 patients had treatment-related adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse event was hand-foot syndrome (11 patients [47.8%]). The most common grade 3 adverse event was hand-foot syndrome (two patients [8.7%]). No grades 4-5 treatment-related adverse events were recorded. This phase 2 trial shows that combining toripalimab with capecitabine has promising antitumour activity and a manageable safety profile for patients with residual nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

A total of 44 patients were enrolled, and the median follow-up duration was 22.9 months (interquartile range: 17.4–24.7). The primary outcome was 6-months progression-free survival (PFS), which was 88.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.4–96.2), meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. The secondary outcomes reported here include median PFS, 12-months PFS, and overall survival and safety.

CDK4/6i retrial as a treatment strategy is commonplace in modern clinical practice; however, the available prospective data investigating this strategy have had inconclusive results. To frame this data in a real-world context, we performed a retrospective analysis assessing the efficacy of CDK4/6is in 195 patients who had previous exposure to CDK4/6i in a prior treatment line at our institution. Among patients who had stopped a CDK4/6i due to toxicity, CDK4/6i retrial either immediately after with a different CDK4/6i or in a further treatment line with the same initial CDK4/6i was both safe and effective, with a median time to treatment failure (TTF) of 10.1 months (95%CI, 4.8–16.9). For patients whose disease progressed on a prior CDK4/6i, we demonstrated comparable median TTFs for patients rechallenged with the same CDK4/6i (4.3 months, 95%CI 3.2–5.5) and with a different CDK4/6i (4.7 months, 95%CI 3.7–6.0) when compared to the recent PACE, PALMIRA, and MAINTAIN trials. Exploratory genomic analysis suggested that the presence of mutations known to confer CDK4/6i resistance, such as TP53 mutations, CDK4 amplifications, and RB1 or FAT1 loss of function mutations may be molecular biomarkers predictive of CDK4/6i retrial failure.",

Here we show single-cell transcriptomics and functional analyses of the myeloid cell lineage in patients with non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (TC) and multinodular goiter, before and after treatment with radioactive iodine compared to healthy controls. Integrative data analysis indicates that monocytes of TC patients have transcriptional upregulation of antigen presentation, reduced cytokine production capacity, and overproduction of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, these cancer-related pathological changes are partially removed upon treatment. In bone marrow, TC patients tend to shift from myelopoiesis towards lymphopoiesis, reflected in transcriptional differences. Taken together, distinct transcriptional and functional changes in myeloid cells arise before their infiltration of the tumor and are already initiated in bone marrow, which suggests an active role in forming the tumor immune microenvironment.",
Characterizing DNA methylation signatures of retinoblastoma using aqueous humor liquid biopsy,"Hong-Tao Li, Liya Xu, Daniel J.

Berry",2022-09-21,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is a cancer that forms in the developing retina of babies and toddlers. The goal of therapy is to cure the tumor, save the eye and maximize vision. However, it is difficult to predict which eyes are likely to respond to therapy. Predictive molecular biomarkers are needed to guide prognosis and optimize treatment decisions. Direct tumor biopsy is not an option for this cancer; however, the aqueous humor (AH) is an alternate source of tumor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Here we show that DNA methylation profiling of the AH is a valid method to identify the methylation status of RB tumors. We identify 294 genes directly regulated by methylation that are implicated in p53 tumor suppressor (RB1, p53, p21, and p16) and oncogenic (E2F) pathways. Finally, we use AH to characterize molecular subtypes that can potentially be used to predict the likelihood of treatment success for retinoblastoma patients.",

In both age groups, survival remains poor at relapse. Therefore, we conducted a comparative study in a large pediatric cohort, including 191 cases and 97 samples from adults. While TP53 and CCND3 mutation frequencies are not age related, samples from pediatric patients showed a higher frequency of mutations in ID3, DDX3X, ARID1A and SMARCA4, while several genes such as BCL2 and YY1AP1 are almost exclusively mutated in adult patients. An unbiased analysis reveals a transition of the mutational profile between 25 and 40 years of age. Survival analysis in the pediatric cohort confirms that TP53 mutations are significantly associated with higher incidence of relapse (25 ± 4% versus 6 ± 2%, p-value 0.0002). This identifies a promising molecular marker for relapse incidence in pediatric BL which will be used in future clinical trials.",

It is thought that high levels of FOXP3 + T cells in breast cancer are associated with poor prognosis. However, data regarding FOXP3 show significant variability in the literature. In our study, we aim to measure MVD and FOXP3 + T cells in breast cancer cases and investigate their relationship with each other and their effects on breast cancer patients’ clinical and prognostic features. In our study, the results of 207 female breast cancer patients whose excisional tumoral tissue was obtained are presented. The study evaluated the findings under a light microscope using antibodies against CD34 for measuring MVD and FOXP3 for measuring FOXP3-positive T cells. CD34 ≥ 17 was categorized as high MVD, and CD34 < 17 was classified as low MVD. FOXP3 + cell count ≥ 20/mm2 was categorized as high FOXP3 positivity and < 20/mm2 as low FOXP3 positivity. The SPSS program (version 22) was used to evaluate the results statistically, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. The median age was 54.0 (27–86) years, and the median follow-up period was 60.0 (IQR: 42.6–86.5) months. In the high MVD group, a higher progesterone receptor (PR) positivity rate was detected (p = 0.035). High FOXP3 positivity was significantly associated with high nuclear grade (p = 0.003). High FOXP3 positivity was significantly associated with PR negativity and high Ki67 values ​​(p = 0.009, p = 0.012, respectively). No statistically significant correlation was found between MVD elevation and FOXP3 positivity (r = 0.063, p = 0.36). A weakly significant positive correlation was detected between high Ki67 and FOXP3 positivity (r = 0.0146, p = 0.04). A weak inverse correlation was detected between high FOXP3 positivity and PR percentage values ​​(r=-0.182, p = 0.01). While there was no significant difference in disease-free survival in cases with high MVD and high FOXP3 + T cells compared to groups with low levels, the results were not mature enough because the median values ​​in overall survival could not be reached. A significant correlation was found between high FOXP3 positivity and some aggressive tumor features; no effect on survival was detected. In contrast to literature data on luminal A breast cancer, high MVD in the luminal B (HER2-) subgroup was associated with a lower risk of recurrence. Our study is the first in the literature to evaluate the relationship between MVD measured using CD34 and FOXP3 positive T cells in breast cancer. Our study found no correlation between MVD and FOXP3 positivity, while literature data show significant correlations in some other cancers.","FOXP3 T cells, Microvascular density, CD34, Breast cancer"

Heller, Jan Grimm",2024-09-09,"The efficacy of fluorescence-guided surgery in facilitating the real-time delineation of tumours depends on the optical contrast of tumour tissue over healthy tissue. Here we show that CJ215—a commercially available, renally cleared carbocyanine dye sensitive to apoptosis, and with an absorption and emission spectra suitable for near-infrared fluorescence imaging (wavelengths of 650–900 nm) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) fluorescence imaging (900–1,700 nm)—can facilitate fluorescence-guided tumour screening, tumour resection and the assessment of wound healing. In tumour models of either murine or human-derived breast, prostate and colon cancers and of fibrosarcoma, and in a model of intraperitoneal carcinomatosis, imaging of CJ215 with ambient light allowed for the delineation of nearly all tumours within 24 h after intravenous injection of the dye, which was minimally taken up by healthy organs. At later timepoints, CJ215 provided tumour-to-muscle contrast ratios up to 100 and tumour-to-liver contrast ratios up to 18. SWIR fluorescence imaging with the dye also allowed for quantifiable non-contact wound monitoring through commercial bandages. CJ215 may be compatible with existing and emerging clinical solutions.",
The CHK1 inhibitor prexasertib in BRCA wild-type platinum-resistant recurrent high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma: a phase 2 trial,"Elena Giudice, Tzu-Ting Huang, Jayakumar R.

Here we report the activity of CHK1i in platinum-resistant high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) with measurable and biopsiable disease (cohort 5), or without biopsiable disease (cohort 6). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes were safety and progression-free survival (PFS). 49 heavily pretreated patients were enrolled (24 in cohort 5, 25 in cohort 6). Among the 39 RECISTv1.1-evaluable patients, ORR was 33.3% in cohort 5 and 28.6% in cohort 6. Primary endpoint was not evaluable due to early stop of the trial. The median PFS was 4 months in cohort 5 and 6 months in cohort 6. Toxicity was manageable. Translational research was an exploratory endpoint. Potential biomarkers were investigated using pre-treatment fresh biopsies and serial blood samples. Transcriptomic analysis revealed high levels of DNA replication-related genes (POLA1, POLE, GINS3) associated with lack of clinical benefit [defined post-hoc as PFS < 6 months]. Subsequent preclinical experiments demonstrated significant cytotoxicity of POLA1 silencing in combination with CHK1i in platinum-resistant HGSOC cell line models. Therefore, POLA1 expression may be predictive for CHK1i resistance, and the concurrent POLA1 inhibition may improve the efficacy of CHK1i monotherapy in this hard-to-treat population, deserving further investigation.",
Fatigue trajectories by wearable remote monitoring of breast cancer patients during radiotherapy,"Angela Barillaro, Chiara Feoli, Adriano Tramontano, Marco Comerci, Mara Caroprese, Renato Cuocolo, Oscar Tamburis, Mario Petrazzuoli, Maria Anna D’Arienzo, Antonio Farella, Caterina Oliviero, Stefania Clemente, Laura Cella, Mario Magliulo, Manuel Conson, Roberto Pacelli",2024-11-08,"The aim of this pilot study was to assess the compliance of breast cancer (BC) patients with fitness tracker (FT) monitoring program during radiotherapy (RT) and to characterize radiation-induced fatigue (RIF) status through objective evaluation using FT-collected parameters. Thirty-six BC patients were invited to wear FT during their RT course for continuous monitoring of heart rate (HR) and step counts (STP). RIF assessment was performed weekly, according to CTCAE v5.0 and dichotomized into G0 vs. any-grade. A novel concept based on patient Repeated Activity Window (RAW) was introduced to evaluate HR and STP variations during RT. Several Machine Learning (ML) methods were trained to characterize RIF on the basis of HR and STP collected data. RIF of any grade was reported by 17 out of 36 patients (47%) included in the study. None of patient clinical variables were significantly correlated with RIF. All patients accepted the FT monitoring program, and for 32 patients FT collection efficiency was greater than 60%. For each patient, a distinct distribution of RAWs was identifiable over RT and across the entire patient cohort, with a total of 7950 RAWs processed. Six features related to RAWs, HR and STP were identified as associated with RIF. The best-performing classifier was the Bagged Trees model, showing a cross-validated ROC-AUC of 89% (95% CI 88–90%). This study confirms the feasibility of continuous biomedical monitoring of BC patients by FT. We successfully identify objective indicators of RIF through HR and STP variation measures within each patient’s RAW, thus providing a novel and practical approach to assess and manage RIF. This can significantly aid medical staff in evaluating RIF trajectories, potentially leading to better individualized care strategies and improved patient outcomes.","Fitness tracker, Radiation-induced fatigue, Breast cancer, Quality-of-life"
Inhibiting ADAM17 enhances the efficacy of olaparib in ovarian cancer spheroids,"Christoph Rogmans, Jan Dittrich, Emily Hamm, Jörg Paul Weimer, David Holthaus, Norbert Arnold, Inken Flörkemeier, Nicolai Maass, Peer Jansen, Astrid Dempfle, Dirk O. Bauerschlag, Nina Hedemann",2024-11-06,"Acquired or de novo resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) is a major challenge to ovarian cancer treatment. Therefore, strategies to overcome PARPi resistance are critical to improve prognosis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether inhibition of ADAM17 sensitizes ovarian cancer to treatment with olaparib, a PARPi, thereby bypassing resistance mechanisms and improving treatment response. Thus, we analyzed the effect of olaparib in combination with the ADAM17 inhibitor GW280264X in ovarian cancer using a 2D monolayer and a 3D spheroid model followed by a multicontent readout (viability, caspase activation and cytotoxicity). To emphasize the translational aspect of our work, we performed corresponding experiments on primary cells derived from ovarian cancer patients initially screened for their mutation status of the breast cancer gene (BRCA 1/2). In 2D, we observed a significant reduction in cell viability and a subsequent increase in apoptosis of the combined treatment (olaparib + GW280264X) compared with olaparib mono-treatment. The combined treatment allows a substantial dose reduction of olaparib rendering a strong synergistic effect. Using a 3D spheroid model from primary cells, we confirmed the 2D monoculture results and demonstrated not only increased caspase activity under the combined treatment but also a substantial gain in cytotoxicity compared to the mono-treatment. Our study proposes ADAM17 inhibition sensitizing ovarian cancer to olaparib treatment and improving treatment response.","Ovarian cancer, PARP-inhibitor, Olaparib, Resistance, ADAM17, 3D tumor spheroids"

To better understand this resistance, we comprehensively profile 100 human uveal melanoma metastases using clinicogenomics, transcriptomics, and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte potency assessment. We find that over half of these metastases harbor tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with potent autologous tumor specificity, despite low mutational burden and resistance to prior immunotherapies. However, we observe strikingly low intratumoral T cell receptor clonality within the tumor microenvironment even after prior immunotherapies. To harness these quiescent tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, we develop a transcriptomic biomarker to enable in vivo identification and ex vivo liberation to counter their growth suppression. Finally, we demonstrate that adoptive transfer of these transcriptomically selected tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can promote tumor immunity in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma when other immunotherapies are incapable.",
A retrospective analysis suggests PTEN expression is associated with favorable clinicopathological features of breast cancer,"Leonard Derkyi-Kwarteng, Frank Naku Ghartey, Eric Aidoo, Ernest Addae, Emmanuel Gustav Imbeah, Ato Ampomah Brown, Samuel Acquah",2024-09-17,"The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, crucial for cell growth and survival. Mutations or loss of PTEN are common in breast cancer, leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Understanding PTEN’s role is vital for targeted therapies. 276 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast cancer tissue blocks from 2012 to 2016 were analyzed for PTEN expression. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify and assess tumor related clinicopathological characteristics as well as patient demographics. These were statistically matched with PTEN expression. Only 27.5% of the breast cancer tumors were PTEN-positive. PTEN expression correlated significantly with smaller tumor size, lower tumor grade, positive estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and favorable/unfavorable Ki67 status (p < 0.001). No significant association was found with vascular invasion, histologic type, age, HER2 status, staging, or lymph node involvement (p > 0.05). The study confirms PTEN's association with favorable clinicopathological features in breast cancer, supporting its role as a prognostic marker. These findings underscore the importance of PTEN in breast cancer biology and its potential as a therapeutic target. Furthermore these findings confirm the prevalence of advanced stage and aggressive breast cancer tumors in Ghana.","PTEN expression, Retrospective analysis, Clinicopathological characteristics, Breast carcinoma, Favorable prognosis, Archival samples"
Integrative analysis of a novel immunogenic PANoptosis‑related gene signature in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for prognostication and therapeutic decision-making,"Ming Xu, Ming Ruan, Wenhua Zhu, Jiayue Xu, Ling Lin, Weili Li, Weirong Zhu",2024-12-05,"This study aimed to develop a PANoptosis-related gene prognostic index (PANGPI) to explore its potential value in predicting the prognosis and immunotherapy response of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Differentially expressed genes of DLBCL from GEO databases were analyzed and mapped to the PANoptosis gene set. The independent prognostic value of the PANGPI signature was evaluated using LASSO Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression. Additionally, the tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) characteristics and mutation landscape of both subgroups were evaluated, and drug sensitivity was predicted using the GDSC database. Furthermore, in silico docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies were presented to elucidate the mode of interaction of these predicted drugs. The PANGPI risk score was an independent risk factor for the prognosis of patients with DLBCL and exhibited good prognostic predictive performance. Furthermore, the cytolytic activity of the TILs was positively correlated with the PANGPI scores. Additionally, the PANGPI enabled the identification of 3 chemotherapeutic agents, including BMS-536924, Gefitinib, Navitoclax for DLBCL patients in the high-risk group. We established a novel PANoptosis-related gene subtyping system in DLBCL, which could shed a novel light on the development of new biomarkers for DLBCL.","Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, PANoptosis, Prognostic index, Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, Drug sensitivity"
Real-time monitoring of bioelectrical impedance for minimizing tissue carbonization in microwave ablation of porcine liver,"Xiao Zhang, Wei Wei, Lu Qian, Liuye Yao, Xiaofei Jin, Lidong Xing, Zhiyu Qian",2024-12-06,"The charring tissue generated by the high temperature during microwave ablation can affect the therapeutic effect, such as limiting the volume of the coagulation zone and causing rejection. This paper aimed to prevent tissue carbonization while delivering an appropriate thermal dose for effective ablations by employing a treatment protocol with real-time bioelectrical impedance monitoring. Firstly, the current field response under different microwave ablation statuses is analyzed based on finite element simulation. Next, the change of impedance measured by the electrodes is correlated with the physical state of the ablated tissue, and a microwave ablation carbonization control protocol based on real-time electrical impedance monitoring was established. The finite element simulation results show that the dielectric properties of biological tissues changed dynamically during the ablation process. Finally, the relative change rule of the electrical impedance magnitude of the ex vivo porcine liver throughout the entire MWA process and the reduction of the central zone carbonization were obtained by the MWA experiment. Charring tissue was eliminated without water cooling at 40 W and significantly reduced at 50 W and 60 W. The carbonization during MWA can be reduced according to the changes in tissue electrical impedance to optimize microwave thermal ablation efficacy.","Microwave ablation, Carbonization, Electrical impedance, Temperature"

The management of NSCLC has improved considerably, especially in the past 10 years. The systematic screening of populations at risk with low-dose CT, the implementation of novel surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques and a deeper biological understanding of NSCLC that has led to innovative systemic treatment options have improved the prognosis of patients with NSCLC. In non-metastatic NSCLC, the combination of various perioperative strategies and adjuvant immunotherapy in locally advanced disease seem to enhance cure rates. In metastatic NSCLC, the implementation of novel drugs might prolong disease control together with preserving quality of life. The further development of predictive clinical and genetic markers will be essential for the next steps in individualized treatment concepts.",
Effect of body mass index on post-treatment oral function in patients with oral cancer: a cross-sectional study,"Yukiho Shimamura, Yuhei Matsuda, Mayu Takeda, Reon Morioka, Tatsuhito Kotani, Takahiro Kanno",2024-09-19,"This single-center cross-sectional study used sequential sampling to examine the influence of body mass index (BMI) on oral function after oral cancer treatment. Patients who completed primary oral cancer treatment between September 2019 and March 2023 (102 patients, 74 male [72.5%] and 28 female [27.5%]; mean age, 69.6 years) were analyzed. Patient background data were collected from electronic medical records. Post-treatment oral function measurements were conducted on all patients using six assessment tools. Statistical analysis was conducted using Pearson’s correlation coefficient, one-way analysis of variance, the Jonckheere–Terpstra test, and multiple linear regression. Pre-treatment BMI showed a statistically significant relationship with postoperative oral function, particularly tongue pressure (P = 0.01). While the mean values of the groups showed no significant differences, the Jonckheere–Terpstra test revealed a statistically significant trend toward a stepwise increase in tongue pressure for each BMI group (P = 0.03). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between tongue pressure and pre-treatment BMI (P < 0.05). Pre-treatment BMI was significantly associated with tongue pressure. Since BMI is a variable factor that can be controlled by nutritional therapy even before treatment, nutritional intervention, weight control, and treatment strategies including reconstructive interventions to maintain tongue pressure may be important in oral cancer treatment.","Body mass index, Oral cancer, Oral function, Postoperative oral dysfunction, Tongue pressure"
Survival of HIV associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma in China,"Yu Xiong, Weicheng Liu, Xiaoping Chen, Pingzheng Mo, Yong Xiong, Liping Deng, Yongxi Zhang",2024-12-05,"Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved outcomes for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This is an analysis of 127 patients with HIV with Burkitt lymphoma (HIV-BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (HIV-DLBCL) treated at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University over a 17-year period during the ART and rituximab era. The median CD4 count for the cohorts was 0.141 × 109/L (range, 0.001-0.861 × 109/L). DA-EPOCH ± R (54%) were most commonly used in HIV-BL. CHOP± R (42%) was most commonly used to treat HIV-DLBCL. The complete response rate after first-line curative therapy was 10/28 (36%) in HIV-BL and 25/57 (44%) in HIV-DLBCL. The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for the HIV-BL cohort was 50% and 41% respectively. The 2-year PFS and OS for the HIV-DLBCL cohort was 55% and 47% respectively. Current China practice favours the treatment of HIV-BL and HIV-DLBCL similarly to the HIV-negative population with the use of concurrent ART. However, due to the extremely low percentage of patients receiving ART prior to the lymphoma diagnosis, the high percentage of patients with poor performance status, and the advanced stage at diagnosis, the treatment of HIV-related lymphoma remains the major challenge in China.",
DDR1 is identified as an immunotherapy target for microsatellite stable colon cancer by CRISPR screening,"Miaoqing Wu, Wenjuan Ma, Guangzhao Lv, Xin Wang, Cong Li, Xiang Chen, Xiaofei Peng, Chaoming Tang, Zhizhong Pan, Ranyi Liu, Gong Chen, Rongxin Zhang",2024-11-07,"The role of collagen and its receptor, discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) in immune response of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. We identified DDR1 as a promising target of immunotherapy resistance using a pooled in vivo CRISPR/sgRNA screening in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC mouse models. Our findings demonstrated that knockdown or inhibition of DDR1 could enhance infiltration of CD8+ T cells and sensitize MSS CRC to PD-1 blockade. Furthermore, DDR1 was found to facilitate kinase domain phosphorylation, upregulate EZH2, consequently elevating H3K27me3 levels at the CXCL10 promotor, which led to the suppression of CXCL10 transcription once bound to collagen in ECM. Lastly, DDR1 was found positively correlated with collagen I expression in MSS CRC specimens. These findings indicated that targeting DDR1 or its inhibitor 7rh might be potential strategy for overcoming immunotherapy resistance in MSS CRC.",

Among all vaccinated patients, including 70 treated prior to progression (primary) and 103 treated after progression (recurrent), the median overall survival from first diagnosis is 31.9 months (95% CI: 25.0–36.5). Adverse events are infrequent and are predominantly grade 1 or 2. A vaccine-induced immune response to at least one of the vaccinated peptides is detected in blood samples of 87 of 97 (90%) monitored patients. Vaccine-specific T-cell responses are durable in most patients. Significantly prolonged survival is observed for patients with multiple vaccine-induced T-cell responses (53 months) compared to those with no/low induced responses (27 months; P = 0.03). Altogether, our results highlight that the application of personalized neoantigen-targeting peptide vaccine is feasible and represents a promising potential treatment option for GBM patients.",
Pyrotinib plus docetaxel as first-line treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: the PANDORA phase II trial,"Yabing Zheng, Wen-Ming Cao, Xiying Shao, Yanxia Shi, Li Cai, Wenyan Chen, Jian Liu, Peng Shen, Yiding Chen, Xian Wang, Huiping Li, Man Li, Zhanhong Chen, Xiaojia Wang",2023-12-14,"The role of pyrotinib in the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has been well-established.

In vitro microscopy methods are widely used for this task but typically require diluting the blood with a buffer to allow for transmission of light. However, whole blood provides crucial signaling cues that influence adhesion dynamics, which means that conventional approaches lack the full physiological complexity of living microvasculature. We can reliably image cell interactions in microfluidic channels during whole blood flow by motion blur microscopy (MBM) in vitro and automate image analysis using machine learning. MBM provides a low cost, easy to implement alternative to intravital microscopy, for rapid data generation where understanding cell interactions, adhesion, and motility is crucial.

The primary endpoint of a confirmed PSA50 response rate was met and estimated at 40% (N = 18/45, 95% CI: 25.7–55.7%, P = 0.02 one-sided against the 25% null hypothesis). Sixteen of the PSA50 responses were achieved before the addition of nivolumab. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), median PSA progression-free survival, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), and safety/tolerability. The ORR was 24% (N = 10/42). Three of the objective responses occurred following the addition of nivolumab. After a median follow-up of 17.9 months, the median rPFS was 5.6 (95% CI: 5.4–6.8) months, and median OS was 24.4 (95% CI: 17.6–31.1) months. BAT/nivolumab was well tolerated, resulting in only five (11%) drug related, grade-3 adverse events. In a predefined exploratory analysis, clinical response rates correlated with increased baseline levels of intratumoral PD-1 + T cells. In paired metastatic tumor biopsies, BAT induced pro-inflammatory gene expression changes that were restricted to patients achieving a clinical response. These data suggest that BAT may augment antitumor immune responses that are further potentiated by immune checkpoint blockade.",

Other secondary endpoints included assessment of viremia, MV replication and shedding, humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus. A 22 interferon stimulated gene (ISG) diagonal linear discriminate analysis (DLDA) classification algorithm in a post-hoc analysis was found to be inversely (R = −0.6, p = 0.04) correlated with viral replication and tumor microenvironment remodeling including proinflammatory changes and CD8 + T cell infiltration in post treatment samples. This data supports that oncolytic MV derivatives warrant further clinical investigation and that an ISG-based DLDA algorithm can provide the basis for treatment personalization.",

Patritumab deruxtecan in HER2-negative breast cancer: part B results of the window-of-opportunity SOLTI-1805 TOT-HER3 trial and biological determinants of early response,"Fara Brasó-Maristany, Juan Manuel Ferrero-Cafiero, Claudette Falato, Olga Martínez-Sáez, Juan Miguel Cejalvo, Mireia Margelí, Pablo Tolosa, Francisco Javier Salvador-Bofill, Josefina Cruz, Blanca González-Farré, Esther Sanfeliu, Andreu Òdena, Violeta Serra, Francisco Pardo, Ana María Luna Barrera, Miriam Arumi, Juan Antonio Guerra, Guillermo Villacampa, Rodrigo Sánchez-Bayona, Eva Ciruelos, Martín Espinosa-Bravo, Yann Izarzugaza, Patricia Galván, Judith Matito, Sonia Pernas, Maria Vidal, Anu Santhanagopal, Dalila Sellami, Stephen Esker, Pang-Dian Fan, Fumitaka Suto, Ana Vivancos, Tomás Pascual, Aleix Prat, Mafalda Oliveira",2024-07-11,"Patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) exhibits promising efficacy in breast cancer, with its activity not directly correlated to baseline ERBB3/HER3 levels. This research investigates the genetic factors affecting HER3-DXd’s response in women with early-stage hormone receptor-positive and HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer. In the SOLTI-1805 TOT-HER3 trial, a single HER3-DXd dose was administered to 98 patients across two parts: 78 patients received 6.4 mg/kg (Part A), and 44 received a lower 5.6 mg/kg dose (Part B). The CelTIL score, measuring tumor cellularity and infiltrating lymphocytes from baseline to day 21, was used to assess drug activity. Part A demonstrated increased CelTIL score after one dose of HER3-DXd. Here we report CelTIL score and safety for Part B. In addition, the exploratory analyses of part A involve a comprehensive study of gene expression, somatic mutations, copy-number segments, and DNA-based subtypes, while Part B focuses on validating gene expression. RNA analyses show significant correlations between CelTIL responses, high proliferation genes (e.g., CCNE1, MKI67), and low expression of luminal genes (e.g., NAT1, SLC39A6). DNA findings indicate that CelTIL response is significantly associated with TP53 mutations, proliferation, non-luminal signatures, and a distinct DNA-based subtype (DNADX cluster-3). Critically, low HER2DX ERBB2 mRNA, correlates with increased HER3-DXd activity, which is validated through in vivo patient-derived xenograft  models. This study proposes chemosensitivity determinants, DNA-based subtype classification, and low ERBB2 expression as potential markers for HER3-DXd activity in HER2-negative breast cancer.",

Although the luminal subtype, which represents >70% of BC cases, is generally associated with a favorable outcome, it is susceptible to metastatic relapse as late as 15 years after treatment discontinuation. Seeking therapeutic approaches as well as screening tools to properly identify those patients with a higher risk of recurrence is therefore essential. Here, we report that the lipid-degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is a predictor of long-term survival in patients with luminal BC, and that it blocks tumor progression and lung metastasis in cell and mouse models of BC. Together, our findings highlight the potential of FAAH as a biomarker with prognostic value in luminal BC and as a therapeutic target in metastatic disease.",
Pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant systemic therapy for breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers and noncarriers,"Sara P. Myers, Varadan Sevilimedu, Andrea V. Barrio, Audree B. Tadros, Anita Mamtani, Mark E. Robson, Monica Morrow, Minna K. Lee",2024-07-26,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variant carriers develop breast cancers with distinct pathological characteristics and mutational signatures that may result in differential response to chemotherapy. We compared rates of pathologic complete response (pCR) after NAC between BRCA1/2 variant carriers and noncarriers in a cohort of 1426 women (92 [6.5%] BRCA1 and 73 [5.1%] BRCA2) with clinical stage I–III breast cancer treated with NAC followed by surgery from 11/2013 to 01/2022 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The majority received doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/paclitaxel therapy (93%); BRCA1/2 carriers were more likely to receive carboplatin (p < 0.001). Overall, pCR was achieved in 42% of BRCA1 carriers, 21% of BRCA2 carriers, and 26% of noncarriers (p = 0.001). Among clinically node-positive (cN+) patients, nodal pCR was more frequent in BRCA1/2 carriers compared to noncarriers (53/96 [55%] vs. 371/856 [43%], p = 0.015). This difference was seen in HR+/HER2− (36% vs. 20% of noncarriers; p = 0.027) and TN subtypes (79% vs. 45% of noncarriers; p < 0.001). In a multivariable analysis of the overall cohort, BRCA1 status, and TN and HER2+ subtypes were independently associated with pCR. These data indicate that BRCA1 carriers may be more likely to achieve overall and nodal pCR in response to NAC compared with BRCA2 carriers and patients with sporadic disease. Further studies with a larger cohort of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers are needed, as a small sample size may have a restricted ability to detect a significant association between mutational status and pCR in sensitivity analyses stratified by subtype and adjusted for clinically relevant factors.",

By genomic and metabolomics analyses of patients’ tumours, metastasis-derived patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and isogenic cell lines we demonstrate that a fraction of metastatic ER + BC is highly reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Treatment by the OXPHOS inhibitor IACS-010759 strongly inhibits tumour growth in multiple endocrine and palbociclib resistant PDX. Mutations in the PIK3CA/AKT1 genes are significantly associated with response to IACS-010759. At the metabolic level, in vivo response to IACS-010759 is associated with decreased levels of metabolites of the glutathione, glycogen and pentose phosphate pathways in treated tumours. In vitro, endocrine and palbociclib resistant cells show increased OXPHOS dependency and increased ROS levels upon IACS-010759 treatment. Finally, in ER + BC patients, high expression of OXPHOS associated genes predict poor prognosis. In conclusion, these results identify OXPHOS as a promising target for treatment resistant ER + BC patients.",
Heterogeneity of claudin 18.2 expression in metastatic gastric cancer,"Eugene Choi, Jinho Shin, Min-Hee Ryu, Hyung-Don Kim, Young Soo Park",2024-07-31,"Claudin 18.2 has emerged as a viable therapeutic target in gastric cancer (GC), but little is known about the heterogeneity of its expression in GC. This study investigated the heterogeneity of claudin 18.2 expression in 166 patients with metastatic GC whose surgical or paired primary–metastatic specimens were available. The prevalence of claudin 18.2 positivity (moderate-to-strong expression in ≥ 75% by the 43-14A clone) was 47.0%. Claudin 18.2-positive tumors exhibited more frequent peritoneal metastasis and a lower incidence of hepatic and distant lymph node involvement. Survival outcomes were comparable between patients with claudin 18.2-positive and -negative tumors. Intratumoral heterogeneity was noted in 38.5% of surgical specimens. Paired primary-metastatic site analysis revealed that 25.2% of patients had discordant results for claudin 18.2 positivity. Across different metastatic organ categories, peritoneal lesions showed the highest positivity rate (44.3%) and positive concordance rate (31.4%), whereas liver lesions had the lowest positivity rate (17.9%) and concordance rate (12.8%). In conclusion, claudin 18.2 expression exhibits intratumoral and intrapatient spatial heterogeneity in metastatic GC. Claudin 18.2 positivity is associated with more frequent peritoneal metastasis, and peritoneal lesions are more likely to have positively concordant claudin 18.2 results with the primary site than other metastatic sites.",

A previously completed phase I study of devimistat in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML showed promising response rates. Here we report the results of a single arm phase II study (NCT02484391). The primary outcome of feasibility of maintenance devimistat following induction and consolidation with devimistat in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone was not met, as maintenance devimistat was only administered in 2 of 21 responders. The secondary outcomes of response (CR + CRi) and median survival were 44% (21/48) and 5.9 months respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities observed. An unplanned, post-hoc analysis of the phase I and II datasets suggests a trend of a dose response in older but not younger patients. RNA sequencing data from patient samples reveals an age-related decline in mitochondrial gene sets. Devimistat impairs ATP synthesis and we find a correlation between mitochondrial membrane potential and sensitivity to chemotherapy. Devimistat also induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and turnover consistent with mitophagy. We find that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mitochondrial fission or autophagy sensitizes cells to devimistat. These findings suggest that an age related decline in mitochondrial quality and autophagy may be associated with response to devimistat however this needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts with proper trial design.",

Molecular drivers of PCNSL have not been fully elucidated. Here, we profile and compare the whole-genome and transcriptome landscape of 51 CNS lymphomas (CNSL) to 39 follicular lymphoma and 36 DLBCL cases outside the CNS. We find recurrent mutations in JAK-STAT, NFkB, and B-cell receptor signaling pathways, including hallmark mutations in MYD88 L265P (67%) and CD79B (63%), and CDKN2A deletions (83%). PCNSLs exhibit significantly more focal deletions of HLA-D (6p21) locus as a potential mechanism of immune evasion. Mutational signatures correlating with DNA replication and mitosis are significantly enriched in PCNSL. TERT gene expression is significantly higher in PCNSL compared to activated B-cell (ABC)-DLBCL. Transcriptome analysis clearly distinguishes PCNSL and systemic DLBCL into distinct molecular subtypes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ CNSL cases lack recurrent mutational hotspots apart from IG and HLA-DRB loci. We show that PCNSL can be clearly distinguished from DLBCL, having distinct expression profiles, IG expression and translocation patterns, as well as specific combinations of genetic alterations.",
Improving maximal safe brain tumor resection with photoacoustic remote sensing microscopy,"Benjamin R. Ecclestone, Kevan Bell, Saad Abbasi, Deepak Dinakaran, Frank K. H. van Landeghem, John R. Mackey, Paul Fieguth, Parsin Haji Reza",2020-10-14,"Malignant brain tumors are among the deadliest neoplasms with the lowest survival rates of any cancer type. In considering surgical tumor resection, suboptimal extent of resection is linked to poor clinical outcomes and lower overall survival rates. Currently available tools for intraoperative histopathological assessment require an average of 20 min processing and are of limited diagnostic quality for guiding surgeries. Consequently, there is an unaddressed need for a rapid imaging technique to guide maximal resection of brain tumors. Working towards this goal, presented here is an all optical non-contact label-free reflection mode photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) microscope. By using a tunable excitation laser, PARS takes advantage of the endogenous optical absorption peaks of DNA and cytoplasm to achieve virtual contrast analogous to standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. In conjunction, a fast 266 nm excitation is used to generate large grossing scans and rapidly assess small fields in real-time with hematoxylin-like contrast. Images obtained using this technique show comparable quality and contrast to the current standard for histopathological assessment of brain tissues. Using the proposed method, rapid, high-throughput, histological-like imaging was achieved in unstained brain tissues, indicating PARS’ utility for intraoperative guidance to improve extent of surgical resection.",

Here we present the final results of a phase Ib/IIa, open-label trial (NCT02871791) of exemestane plus everolimus and palbociclib for CDK4/6i-resistant metastatic breast cancer. The primary objective of phase Ib was to evaluate safety and tolerability and determine the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (100 mg palbociclib, 5 mg everolimus, 25 mg exemestane). The primary objective of phase IIa was to determine the clinical benefit rate (18.8%, n = 6/32), which did not meet the predefined endpoint (65%). Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic profiling (phase Ib), objective response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, and progression free survival (phase IIa), and correlative multi-omics analysis to investigate biomarkers of resistance to CDK4/6i. All participants were female. Multi-omics data from the phase IIa patients (n = 24 tumor/17 blood biopsy exomes; n = 27 tumor transcriptomes) showed potential mechanisms of resistance (convergent evolution of HER2 activation, BRAFV600E), identified joint genomic/transcriptomic resistance features (ESR1 mutations, high estrogen receptor pathway activity, and a Luminal A/B subtype; ERBB2/BRAF mutations, high RTK/MAPK pathway activity, and a HER2-E subtype), and provided hypothesis-generating results suggesting that mTOR pathway activation correlates with response to the trial’s therapy. Our results illustrate how genome and transcriptome sequencing may help better identify patients likely to respond to CDK4/6i therapies.",

Neurosurgeons perform tumor resection based on tactile sensations. However, it takes years of surgical experience to appropriately distinguish brain tumors from surrounding parenchymal tissue. Haptics is a technology related to the touch sensation. Haptic technology can amplify, transmit, record, and reproduce real sensations, and the physical properties (e.g., stiffness) of an object can be quantified. In the present study, glioblastoma (SF126-firefly luciferase-mCherry [FmC], U87-FmC, U251-FmC) and malignant meningioma (IOMM-Lee-FmC, HKBMM-FmC) cell lines were transplanted into nude mice, and the stiffness of tumors and normal brain tissues were measured using our newly developed surgical forceps equipped with haptic technology. We found that all five brain tumor tissues were stiffer than normal brain tissue (p < 0.001), and that brain tumor pathology (three types of glioblastomas, two types of malignant meningioma) was significantly stiffer than normal brain tissue (p < 0.001 for all). Our findings suggest that tissue stiffness may be a useful marker to distinguish brain tumors from surrounding parenchymal tissue during microsurgery, and that haptic forceps may help neurosurgeons to sense minute changes in tissue stiffness.","Haptics, Microsurgery, Artificial intelligence (AI), Glioblastoma, Tumor stiffness"

Our outcome datasets comprise 378,142 cases across breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, endometrial, oesophageal, renal, and ovarian cancers, as well as 485,715 controls. We complement this analysis by systematically mining the literature space for supporting evidence. In addition to providing supporting evidence for well-established risk factors (smoking, alcohol, obesity, lack of physical activity), we also find sex steroid hormones, plasma lipids, and telomere length as determinants of cancer risk. A number of the molecular factors we identify may prove to be potential biomarkers. Our analysis, which highlights aetiological similarities and differences in common cancers, should aid public health prevention strategies to reduce cancer burden.

The trace elemental components in commercially packaged forms of tobacco can play a significant role in the pathogenesis of oral cancer. To qualitatively assess the trace elements in various types of commercially packaged forms of tobacco using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Two popular varieties of ‘Paan masala’ that contained a mixture of slaked lime with areca nut, catechu, and other flavouring agents (tobacco was absent) and four types of packaged tobacco were obtained from ‘Paan’ shops. The contents in the packets were made into pellets using a hydraulic press and subjected to elemental analysis using LIBS. A ten-trial experiment was carried out on all six pellets. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database was used to assess the emission lines. The elements obtained from commercially packaged tobacco and Paan masala were similar: calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), aluminium (Al), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr). Substances that cause DNA damage and carcinogenesis are inorganic elements such as nickel. Our study revealed that carcinogens such as nickel are present in the commercially packaged forms of tobacco and ‘Paan masala’ samples.","Oral cancer, Smokeless tobacco, Trace elements, Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy"
Radiotherapy is recommended for hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients after breast conserving surgery,"Yaxiong Liu, Jinsong Li, Honghui Li, Gongyin Zhang, Changwang Li, Changlong Wei, Jinsheng Zeng",2024-09-12,"In this study, the necessity of radiotherapy (RT) for hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was investigated. The data of hormone receptor-negative invasive breast cancer patients who underwent BCS were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015. All patients were separated into two groups, namely, the RT group and the no radiotherapy (No RT) group. The 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) rates were compared between the No RT and RT groups after propensity score matching (PSM). The nomograms for predicting the survival of patients were constructed from variables identified by univariate or multivariate Cox regression analysis. A total of 2504 patients were enrolled in the training cohort, and 630 patients were included in the validation cohort. After PSM, 738 patients were enrolled in the No RT group and RT group. We noted that RT can improve survival in hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients who undergo BCS. Based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, age, race, tumour grade, receipt of RT and chemotherapy, pathological T stage, N status, M status and HER2 status were linked to OS and CSS for these patients, and nomograms for predicting OS and CSS were constructed and validated. Moreover, RT improved OS and CSS in hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients who underwent BCS. In addition, the proposed nomograms more accurately predicted OS and CSS for hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients after BCS.","Radiotherapy, Hormone receptor-negative older breast cancer patients, Breast conserving surgery, Prognosis, Nomograms"
MRI-measured periprostatic to subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness ratio as an independent risk factor in prostate cancer patients undergoing radical prostatectomy,"Shanshan Jiang, Yi Li, Yusheng Guo, Bingxin Gong, Chengcheng Wei, Weiwei Liu, Chao Chen, Feng Pan, Jiyu Song, Qingliu He, Lian Yang, Guofeng Zhou",2024-09-08,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the periprostatic adipose tissue thickness (PPATT) is an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer patients after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP). This retrospective cohort study included consecutive prostate cancer patients who underwent LRP treatment at Wuhan Union Hospital from June 2, 2016, to September 7, 2023. PPATT was defined as the thickness of periprostatic fat and was obtained by measuring the shortest vertical distance from the pubic symphysis to the prostate on the midsagittal T2-weighted MR images. Subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness (SATT) was obtained by measuring the shortest vertical distance from the pubic symphysis to the skin at the same slice with PPATT. The primary outcome of the study was biochemical recurrence (BCR), and the secondary outcome was overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors for prostate cancer survival and prognosis. Based on the optimal cutoff value, 162 patients were divided into a low PPATT/SATT group (n = 82) and a high PPATT/SATT group (n = 80). During the entire follow-up period (median 23.5 months), 26 patients in the high PPATT/SATT group experienced BCR (32.5%), compared to 18 in the low PPATT/SATT group (22.0%). Kaplan–Meier curve analysis indicated that the interval to BCR was significantly shorter in the high PPATT/SATT group (P = 0.037). Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed that an increase in the PPATT/SATT ratio was associated with BCR (hazard ratio: 1.90, 95% CI, 1.03–3.51; P = 0.040). The PPATT/SATT ratio is a significant independent risk factor for BCR after LRP for prostate cancer patients.","Periprostatic adipose tissue thickness, Subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness, Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, Prostate cancer, Biochemical recurrence, Prognosis"

However, the impact of cross-presenting cDC1 and the potential of DC-based therapies in tumors carrying varied levels of bona-fide neoantigens (neoAgs) remain unclear. Here we develop a hypermutated model of non-small cell lung cancer in female mice, encoding genuine MHC-I neoepitopes to study neoAgs-specific CD8 T cell responses in spontaneous settings and upon Flt3L + αCD40 (DC-therapy). We find that cDC1 are required to generate broad CD8 responses against a range of diverse neoAgs. DC-therapy promotes immunogenicity of weaker neoAgs and strongly inhibits the growth of high tumor-mutational burden (TMB) tumors. In contrast, low TMB tumors respond poorly to DC-therapy, generating mild CD8 T cell responses that are not sufficient to block progression. scRNA transcriptional analysis, immune profiling and functional assays unveil the changes induced by DC-therapy in lung tissues, which comprise accumulation of cDC1 with increased immunostimulatory properties and less exhausted effector CD8 T cells. We conclude that boosting cDC1 activity is critical to broaden the diversity of anti-tumoral CD8 T cell responses and to leverage neoAgs content for therapeutic advantage.",

Nanodynamo is based on mathematical modelling following sequencing of native RNA from cellular fractions and polysomes. We have applied this workflow to triple-negative breast cancer cells, revealing widespread post-transcriptional RNA processing that is mutually exclusive with its co-transcriptional counterpart. We used Nanodynamo to unravel the coupling between transcription, processing, export, decay and translation machineries. We have identified a number of coupling interactions within and between the nucleus and cytoplasm that largely contribute to coordinating how cells respond to perturbations that affect gene expression programs. Nanodynamo will be instrumental in unravelling the determinants and regulatory processes involved in the coordination of gene expression responses.",

In this study, we morphologically analyzed a novel mouse model of obstructive hydronephrosis from onset to progression to clarify the effects of eosinophils and CLP on the development of hydronephrosis and tumorigenesis. The primary change was slight eosinophil infiltration of the ureteropelvic junction, even at 1 week of age, followed by a significant increase in CLP expression in the urothelium at 5 weeks of age, which led to proliferation of the urothelium. At 8 weeks of age, polyps with eosinophilic inflammation and urothelial hyperplasia expressing high levels of CLP formed at the ureteropelvic junction, leading to hydronephrosis. At 60 weeks of age, all mice with hydronephrosis exhibited chronic eosinophilic inflammation and adenomas that progressed to adenocarcinomas with high CLP expression. In summary, inflammation and epithelial proliferation at the ureteropelvic junction began with a single infiltration of eosinophils at the juvenile stage in mice. Eosinophilic inflammation is associated with the development of hydronephrosis and urothelial hyperplasia, which may progress to urothelial adenocarcinoma due to increased CLP expression.","Chitinase-like protein, Crystal, Eosinophil, Hydronephrosis, Mouse, Urothelial adenocarcinoma"
Mitochondrial rewiring with small-molecule drug-free nanoassemblies unleashes anticancer immunity,"Lulu Ren, Jianqin Wan, Xiaoyan Li, Jie Yao, Yan Ma, Fanchao Meng, Shusen Zheng, Weidong Han, Hangxiang Wang",2024-09-03,"The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a major obstacle to tumor control and causes suboptimal responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Thus, developing feasible therapeutic strategies that trigger inflammatory responses in the TME could improve the ICB efficacy. Mitochondria play an essential role in inflammation regulation and tumor immunogenicity induction. Herein, we report the discovery and characterization of a class of small molecules that can recapitulate aqueous self-assembly behavior, specifically target cellular organelles (e.g., mitochondria), and invigorate tumor cell immunogenicity. Mechanistically, this nanoassembly platform dynamically rewires mitochondria, induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, and causes apoptosis/paraptosis-associated immunogenic cell death. After treatment, stressed and dying tumor cells can act as prophylactic or therapeutic cancer vaccines. In preclinical mouse models of cancers with intrinsic or acquired resistance to PD-1 blockade, the local administration of nanoassemblies inflames the immunologically silent TME and synergizes with ICB therapy, generating potent antitumor immunity. This chemically programmed small-molecule immune enhancer acts distinctly from regular cytotoxic therapeutics and offers a promising strategy for synchronous and dynamic tailoring of innate immunity to achieve traceless cancer therapy and overcome immunosuppression in cancers.",

The plastic TME, and the poor systemic tolerability of immune activating drugs are, however, fundamental barriers to generating curative anticancer immune responses. Here, we introduce the CarboCell technology to overcome these barriers by forming an intratumoral sustained drug release depot that provides high payloads of immune stimulatory drugs selectively within the TME. The CarboCell thereby induces a hot spot for immune cell training and polarization and further drives and maintains the tumor-draining lymph nodes in an anticancer and immune activated state. Mechanistically, this transforms cancerous tissues, consequently generating systemic anticancer immunoreactivity. CarboCell can be injected through standard thin-needle technologies and has inherent imaging contrast which secure accurate intratumoral positioning. In particular, here we report the therapeutic performance for a dual-drug CarboCell providing sustained release of a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist and a transforming growth factor-β inhibitor in preclinical tumor models in female mice.",
Neutrophils in cancer: from biology to therapy,"Leo Koenderman, Nienke Vrisekoop",2024-12-09,"The view of neutrophils has shifted from simple phagocytic cells, whose main function is to kill pathogens, to very complex cells that are also involved in immune regulation and tissue repair. These cells are essential for maintaining and regaining tissue homeostasis. Neutrophils can be viewed as double-edged swords in a range of situations. The potent killing machinery necessary for immune responses to pathogens can easily lead to collateral damage to host tissues when inappropriately controlled. Furthermore, some subtypes of neutrophils are potent pathogen killers, whereas others are immunosuppressive or can aid in tissue healing. Finally, in tumor immunology, many examples of both protumorigenic and antitumorigenic properties of neutrophils have been described. This has important consequences for cancer therapy, as targeting neutrophils can lead to either suppressed or stimulated antitumor responses. This review will discuss the current knowledge regarding the pro- and antitumorigenic roles of neutrophils, leading to the concept of a confused state of neutrophil-driven pro-/antitumor responses.","neutrophil, immune suppression, cancer, tumor-associated neutrophils, confused immune response, myeloid derived suppressor cells"

Re-irradiation is underused due to concerns about irreversible side effects. Pulsed-reduced dose rate radiotherapy (PRDR) aims to reduce toxicity while improving tumor control by exploiting dose-rate effects. We share our initial experience with temporally modulated pulsed proton re-irradiation (TMPPR), focusing on workflow, safety, feasibility, and outcomes for the first patient cohort. TMPPR was administered to patients with recurrent or progressive central nervous system malignancies using intensity modulated proton therapy with three fields. Patient and treatment data were collected, responses categorized using RANO assessment, and toxicities graded using CTCAE v5.0. Five patients received TMPPR between October 2022 and May 2023, with a median age of 54 years (Range: 32–72), and a median time from initial radiotherapy to re-RT of 23 months (Range 14–40). Treatment was completed without delay, with a median dose of 60 GyRBE in 30 fractions. Initial treatment response assessment showed complete (n = 1) or partial (n = 3) responses. Limited toxicity was observed, primarily grade 2 alopecia and one case of radiation necrosis graded at 2. This early experience demonstrates the feasibility of TMPPR delivery, highlighting the importance of prospective evaluations in the re-irradiation setting.","Temporally modulated proton re-irradiation, Recurrence/progression, CNS malignancies, Pulsed-reduced dose rate"

However, the effects of nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, capecitabine, or the combination in changing peripheral immunoscore (PIS) remains unclear. This open-label randomized phase II OXEL study (NCT03487666) aimed to assess the immunologic effects of nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination in terms of the change in PIS (primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints included the presence of ctDNA, toxicity, clinical outcomes at 2-years and association of ctDNA and PIS with clinical outcomes. Forty-five women with TNBC and residual invasive disease after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy were randomized to nivolumab, capecitabine, or the combination. Here we show that treatment with immunotherapy containing arms (nivolumab or a combination of nivolumab plus capecitabine) leads to an increase in PIS from baseline to week 6 compared with capecitabine alone, meeting the pre-specified primary endpoint. In addition, the presence of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is associated with disease recurrence, with no new safety signals in the combination arm. Our results provide efficacy and safety data on this combination in TNBC and support further development of PIS and ctDNA analyses to identify patients at high risk of recurrence.",
Associations of head and neck cancers with herpes zoster in the preceding five years,"Chao-Hung Chen, Sudha Xirasagar, Shih-Han Hung, Herng-Ching Lin, Chin-Shyan Chen",2024-09-15,"This population-based study investigated the risk of having had prior herpes zoster within five years preceding a diagnosis of head and neck cancer. We conducted a case-control study that included 9,191 patients with a diagnosis of head and neck cancer in Taiwan’s Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2010 and 36,764 matched controls. We assessed the odds of patients with head and neck cancer having had a diagnosis of herpes zoster during the five years preceding head and neck cancer using multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of prior herpes zoster among the total sample was 4.6%, 7.9% and 3.8% among patients with and without head and neck cancer, respectively (p < 0.001). The odds ratio of herpes zoster among the head and neck cancer- versus control group was 2.198 (95% CI = 2.001 ~ 2.415) after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use disorder, HPV infection, and alcohol dependence syndrome. Statistically significant excess odds were observed for all specific subtypes of head and neck cancer except for sinonasal cancer. Herpes zoster infection within the 5 years preceding a diagnosis of head and neck cancer may be a harbinger of developing head and neck cancer.","Head and neck cancer, Herpes zoster, Epidemiology"
Predictive nomogram for ischemic stroke risk in clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients,"Jie Wen, Yi Rong, Yinbo Kang, Dingyang Lv, Fan Cui, Huiyu Zhou, Mohan Jia, Qiwei Wang, Weibing Shuang",2024-12-04,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and ischemic stroke are critical global health challenges with a notable association. This study explores the correlation between tumor-related factors and ischemic stroke risk, aiming to construct a predictive nomogram model for ischemic stroke in ccRCC patients. We retrospectively analyzed data from ccRCC patients who underwent nephrectomy at the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University between January 1, 2013, and May 31, 2022. The data were randomly divided into a training cohort (70%) and a validation cohort (30%). Predictive factors were identified using univariate logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram and a Shiny local calculator were developed using these predictors. We identified six predictors for the nomogram: WHO/ISUP grade, diabetes, hypertension, LDL-C, age, and D-dimer. The nomogram showed good discrimination, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.816 in the training cohort and 0.775 in the validation cohort. The optimal cutoff value was 53.7%. The model demonstrated excellent calibration and clinical applicability. WHO/ISUP grade correlates with ischemic stroke risk, offering insights into cancer-related ischemic stroke mechanisms. This nomogram aids in identifying high-risk individuals among ccRCC patients, facilitating early management and improved outcomes.","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma, Ischemic stroke, Nomogram"
Hu similarity coefficient: a clinically oriented metric to evaluate contour accuracy in radiation therapy,"Harold Yang Hu, Shaw Yang Hu, Min Yang, Yanle Hu",2024-12-04,"To propose a clinically oriented quantitative metric, Hu similarity coefficient (HSC), to evaluate contour quality, gauge the performance of auto contouring methods, and aid effective allocation of clinical resources. The HSC is defined as the ratio of the number of boundary points of the initial contour that doesn’t require modifications over the number of boundary points of the final adjusted contour. To demonstrate the clinical utility of the HSC in contour evaluation, we used publicly available pelvic CT data from the Cancer Imaging Archive. The bladder was selected as the organ of interest. It was contoured by a certified medical dosimetrist and reviewed by a certified medical physicist. This contour served as the ground truth contour. From this contour, we simulated two contour sets. The first set had the same Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) but different HSCs, whereas the second set kept a constant HSC while exhibiting different DSCs. Four individuals were asked to adjust the simulated contours until they met clinical standards. The corresponding contour modification times were recorded and normalized by individual’s manual contouring times from scratch. The normalized contour modification time was correlated to the HSC and DSC to evaluate their suitability as quantitative metrics assessing contour quality. The HSC maintained a strong correlation with the normalized contour modification time when both sets of simulated contours were included in analysis. The correlation between the DSC and normalized contour modification time, however, was weak. Compared to the DSC, the HSC is more suitable for evaluating contour quality. We demonstrated that the HSC correlated well with the average normalized contour modification time. Clinically, contour modification time is the most relevant factor in allocating clinical resources. Therefore, the HSC is better suited than the DSC to assess contour quality from a clinical perspective.","Organ contouring, Quantitative Metric, Contour Accuracy, Radiation Therapy"
A reliable murine model of bone metastasis by injecting cancer cells through caudal arteries,"Takahiro Kuchimaru, Naoya Kataoka, Kenji Nakagawa, Tatsuhiro Isozaki, Hitomi Miyabara, Misa Minegishi, Tetsuya Kadonosono, Shinae Kizaka-Kondoh",2018-07-30,"Although the current murine model of bone metastasis using intracardiac (IC) injection successfully recapitulates the process of bone metastasis, further progress in the study of bone metastasis requires a new model to circumvent some limitations of this model. Here, we present a new murine model of bone metastasis achieved by injecting cancer cells through the intra-caudal arterial (CA). This model does not require high technical proficiency, predominantly delivers cancer cells to bone marrow of hind limbs with much higher efficiency than IC injection, and greatly shortens the period of overt bone metastasis development. Moreover, CA injection barely causes acute death of mice, enabling us to inject a larger number of cancer cells to further accelerate the development of bone metastasis with a wide variety of cell lines. Our model may open a new avenue for understanding the bone metastatic processes and development of drugs preventing bone metastasis and recurrence.",

Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 in vivo, we target five potential tumor suppressor genes (Pten, Trp53, Rb1, Stk11, and RnaseL) in the mouse prostate, reaching humane endpoint after eight weeks without metastasis. By further depleting three epigenetic factors (Kmt2c, Kmt2d, and Zbtb16), lung metastases are present in all mice. While whole genome sequencing reveals few mutations in coding sequence, RNA sequencing shows significant dysregulation, especially in a conserved genomic region at chr5qE1 regulated by KMT2C. Depleting Odam and Cabs1 in this region prevents metastasis. Notably, the gene expression signatures, resulting from our study, predict progression-free and overall survival and distinguish primary and metastatic human prostate cancer. This study emphasizes positive genetic interactions between classical tumor suppressor genes and epigenetic modulators in metastatic PCa progression, offering insights into potential treatments.",
Consistent FFP2-masking as part of reducing viral respiratory infections on medical wards for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"T. Richardson, D. Schütte, K. Feyer, L. Grass, M.

Holtick",2024-09-14,"Patients undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are highly susceptible to infections. The consequent use of masks on wards for allo-HSCT has been controversial in the past decades and was not common before the COVID-19 pandemic. We retrospectively compared incidence and outcomes of viral respiratory infections during allo-HSCT on our specialized ward between 01/2018 and 09/2020 to the era of FFP2 masking between 10/2020 and 10/2022 covering similar seasons of the year. Each group consisted of 150 matched patients. The usage of FFP2 masks reduced the incidence of viral respiratory infections from 22.1 to 2.1% (p < 0.005). This reduced the time on ward from a median of 26 days to 23.5 days (p = 0.002). It also resulted in less use of CT-scans (p = 0.003) and bronchoalveolar lavage procedures (p = 0.057). Median time to proof of infection was 21 days after admission in both groups. No difference was detected in progression free survival, hospital survival or non-relapse mortality (p = 0.78). Our retrospective results indicate that FFP2 masks worn by patients and hospital staff may help to significantly reduce the incidence of viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19, shorten the in-hospital time, and reduce costs without affecting survival.",
Mendelian randomization study on the association of circulating ketone bodies with lung cancer and respiratory diseases,"Xisha Tang, Huijia Zhuang, Hai Yu",2024-12-04,"The liver produces various ketone bodies (KBs) including 3-Hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and acetone, with 3-OHB being the major component. Previous studies have shown that KBs protect against respiratory diseases; however, there is no evidence of a genetic link. To avoid biases existing in traditional observational studies, a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was carried out to investigate genetic causation and novel therapeutic uses for KBs. This study used databases from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and single nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables for KBs from a recently published metabonomics study (n = 121,584) and respiratory diseases [lung cancer, n = 85,716; asthma, n = 127,669; chronic bronchitis, n = 450,422; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), n = 468,475; FEV1/FVC < 0.7, n = 353,315] from their publicly available GWAS, respectively. Strong sets of instrumental variables (P < 5 × 10− 8) were selected, with inverse-variance weighted as the primary MR method. Sensitivity analyses included Cochran’s Q test, MR Egger, MR-PRESSO, leave-one-out test, and funnel plots. The Steiger test and reversed MR were used to exclude reverse causality. Additionally, independent replication MR studies were conducted using databases from another large public GWAS and similar methods as described above. After MR analyses and sensitivity filtering, we discovered a protective effect of 3-OHB on lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 0.771; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.648–0.916; PFDR=0.006), small cell carcinoma (OR = 0.485, 95% CI = 0.301–0.781, PFDR=0.006), asthma (OR = 0.585, 95% CI = 0.395–0.867, PFDR=0.010), chronic bronchitis (OR = 0.753, 95% CI = 0.570–0.994, PFDR=0.045), COPD (OR = 0.690, 95% CI = 0.535–0.890, PFDR=0.008) and lung function (OR = 0.970, 95%CI = 0.950–0.990, PFDR =0.008). In summary, our findings suggest that 3-OHB acts as a protective factor against lung cancer and respiratory diseases. However, heterogeneity implies that other mechanisms may also be involved in COPD improvement by 3-OHB.","3-Hydroxybutyrate, Lung cancer, COPD, Asthma, Mendelian randomization"

We enrolled 25 patients aged ≥18 years diagnosed with BCBM and rGBM to receive a single intravenous dose of SG at 10 mg/kg given one day before resection and continued on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles following recovery. The PFS was 8 months and 2 months for BCBM and rGBM cohorts, respectively. The OS was 35.2 months and 9.5 months, respectively. Grade≥3 AE included neutropenia (28%), hypokalemia (8%), seizure (8%), thromboembolic event (8%), urinary tract infection (8%) and muscle weakness of the lower limb (8%). In post-surgical tissue, the median total SN-38 was 249.8 ng/g for BCBM and 104.5 ng/g for rGBM, thus fulfilling the primary endpoint. Biomarker analysis suggests delivery of payload by direct release at target site and that hypoxic changes do not drive indirect release. Secondary endpoint of OS was 35.2 months for the BCBM cohort and 9.5 months for rGBM. Non-planned exploratory endpoint of ORR was 38% for BCBM and 29%, respectively.

Bax",2023-04-25,"Outcomes for half of patients with melanoma remain poor despite standard-of-care checkpoint inhibitor therapies. The prevalence of the melanoma-associated antigen chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) expression is ~70%, therefore effective immunotherapies directed at CSPG4 could benefit many patients. Since IgE exerts potent immune-activating functions in tissues, we engineer a monoclonal IgE antibody with human constant domains recognizing CSPG4 to target melanoma. CSPG4 IgE binds to human melanomas including metastases, mediates tumoricidal antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and stimulates human IgE Fc-receptor-expressing monocytes towards pro-inflammatory phenotypes. IgE demonstrates anti-tumor activity in human melanoma xenograft models engrafted with human effector cells and is associated with enhanced macrophage infiltration, enriched monocyte and macrophage gene signatures and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment. IgE prolongs the survival of patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice reconstituted with autologous immune cells. No ex vivo activation of basophils in patient blood is measured in the presence of CSPG4 IgE. Our findings support a promising IgE-based immunotherapy for melanoma.",
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells promote regulatory T cell development and suppressive activity via CD70-CD27 interaction,"Lanqi Gong, Jie Luo, Yu Zhang, Yuma Yang, Shanshan Li, Xiaona Fang, Baifeng Zhang, Jiao Huang, Larry Ka-Yue Chow, Dittman Chung, Jinlin Huang, Cuicui Huang, Qin Liu, Lu Bai, Yuen Chak Tiu, Pingan Wu, Yan Wang, George Sai-Wah Tsao, Dora Lai-wan Kwong, Anne Wing-Mui Lee, Wei Dai, Xin-Yuan Guan",2023-04-06,"Despite the intense CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, anti-PD-1 immunotherapy shows an unsatisfactory response rate in clinical trials, hindered by immunosuppressive signals. To understand how microenvironmental characteristics alter immune homeostasis and limit immunotherapy efficacy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, here we establish a multi-center single-cell cohort based on public data, containing 357,206 cells from 50 patient samples. We reveal that nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells enhance development and suppressive activity of regulatory T cells via CD70-CD27 interaction. CD70 blocking reverts Treg-mediated suppression and thus reinvigorate CD8+ T-cell immunity. Anti-CD70+ anti-PD-1 therapy is evaluated in xenograft-derived organoids and humanized mice, exhibiting an improved tumor-killing efficacy. Mechanistically, CD70 knockout inhibits a collective lipid signaling network in CD4+ naïve and regulatory T cells involving mitochondrial integrity, cholesterol homeostasis, and fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, ATAC-Seq delineates that CD70 is transcriptionally upregulated by NFKB2 via an Epstein-Barr virus-dependent epigenetic modification. Our findings identify CD70+ nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells as a metabolic switch that enforces the lipid-driven development, functional specialization and homeostasis of Tregs, leading to immune evasion. This study also demonstrates that CD70 blockade can act synergistically with anti-PD-1 treatment to reinvigorate T-cell immunity against nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",
Sex hormones and risk of lung and colorectal cancers in women: a Mendelian randomization study,"Marion Denos, Yi-Qian Sun, Ben Michael Brumpton, Yafang Li, Demetrius Albanes, Andrea Burnett-Hartman, Peter T. Campbell, Sébastien Küry, Christopher I. Li, Emily White, Jewel N. Samadder, Mark A. Jenkins, Xiao-Mei Mai",2024-10-12,"The roles of sex hormones such as estradiol, testosterone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in the etiology of lung and colorectal cancers in women, among the most common cancers after breast cancer, are unclear. This Mendelian randomization (MR) study evaluated such potential causal associations in women of European ancestry. We used summary statistics data from genome-wide association studies on sex hormones and from the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT) and large consortia on cancers. There was suggestive evidence of 1-standard deviation increase in total testosterone levels being associated with a lower risk of lung non-adenocarcinoma (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.37–0.98) in the HUNT Study. However, this was not confirmed by using data from a larger consortium. In general, we did not find convincing evidence to support a causal role of sex hormones on risk of lung and colorectal cancers in women of European ancestry.","Colorectal cancer, Estradiol, HUNT, Lung cancer, Mendelian randomization, Sex hormones"
Antibody-drug conjugates with dual payloads for combating breast tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance,"Chisato M. Yamazaki, Aiko Yamaguchi, Yasuaki Anami, Wei Xiong, Yoshihiro Otani, Jangsoon Lee, Naoto T. Ueno, Ningyan Zhang, Zhiqiang An, Kyoji Tsuchikama",2021-06-10,"Breast tumors generally consist of a diverse population of cells with varying gene expression profiles. Breast tumor heterogeneity is a major factor contributing to drug resistance, recurrence, and metastasis after chemotherapy. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are emerging chemotherapeutic agents with striking clinical success, including T-DM1 for HER2-positive breast cancer. However, these ADCs often suffer from issues associated with intratumor heterogeneity. Here, we show that homogeneous ADCs containing two distinct payloads are a promising drug class for addressing this clinical challenge. Our conjugates show HER2-specific cell killing potency, desirable pharmacokinetic profiles, minimal inflammatory response, and marginal toxicity at therapeutic doses. Notably, a dual-drug ADC exerts greater treatment effect and survival benefit than does co-administration of two single-drug variants in xenograft mouse models representing intratumor HER2 heterogeneity and elevated drug resistance. Our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of the dual-drug ADC format for treating refractory breast cancer and perhaps other cancers.",

We present a single arm Phase II study of 18 patients with LMD receiving combined ipilimumab and nivolumab until progression or unacceptable toxicity (NCT02939300). The primary end point is overall survival at 3 months (OS3). Secondary end points include toxicity, cumulative time-to-progression at 3 months, and progression-free survival. A Simon two-stage design is used to compare a null hypothesis OS3 of 18% against an alternative of 44%. Median follow up based on patients still alive is 8.0 months (range: 0.5 to 15.9 months). The study has met its primary endpoint as 8 of 18 (OS3 0.44; 90% CI: 0.24 to 0.66) patients are alive at three months. One third of patients have experienced one (or more) grade-3 or higher adverse events. Two patients have discontinued protocol treatment due to unacceptable toxicity (hepatitis and colitis, respectively). The most frequent adverse events include fatigue (N = 7), nausea (N = 6), fever (N = 6), anorexia (N = 6) and rash (N = 6). Combined ipilimumab and nivolumab has an acceptable safety profile and demonstrates promising activity in LMD patients. Larger, multicenter clinical trials are needed to validate these results.",

We report the results of the PEMDAC phase 2 clinical trial (n = 29; NCT02697630) where the HDAC inhibitor entinostat was combined with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic uveal melanoma (UM). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), and was met with an ORR of 14%. The clinical benefit rate at 18 weeks was 28%, median progression free survival was 2.1 months and the median overall survival was 13.4 months. Toxicities were manageable, and there were no treatment-related deaths. Objective responses and/or prolonged survival were seen in patients with BAP1 wildtype tumors, and in one patient with an iris melanoma that exhibited a UV signature. Longer survival also correlated with low baseline ctDNA levels or LDH. In conclusion, HDAC inhibition and anti-PD1 immunotherapy results in durable responses in a subset of patients with metastatic UM.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT02697630 (registered 3 March 2016).

We conducted a single-arm, non-randomized, phase II trial (NCT03104439) combining radiation, ipilimumab and nivolumab to treat patients with metastatic MSS CRC (n = 40) and PDAC (n = 25) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. The primary endpoint was disease control rate (DCR) by intention to treat. DCRs were 25% for CRC (ten of 40; 95% confidence interval (CI), 13–41%) and 20% for PDAC (five of 25; 95% CI, 7–41%). In the per-protocol analysis, defined as receipt of radiation, DCR was 37% (ten of 27; 95% CI, 19–58%) in CRC and 29% (five of 17; 95% CI, 10–56%) in PDAC. Pretreatment biopsies revealed low tumor mutational burden for all samples but higher numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and expression of the HERVK repeat RNA in patients with disease control. This study provides proof of concept of combining radiation with immune checkpoint blockade in immunotherapy-resistant cancers.",

Over the past decade, the incidence of LMD has steadily increased due to therapeutics that have extended the survival of cancer patients, highlighting the need for new interventions. To examine the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in patients with LMD, we completed two phase II clinical trials. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular features underpinning observed patient trajectories in these trials by applying single-cell RNA and cell-free DNA profiling to longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) draws from enrolled patients. We recover immune and malignant cell types in the CSF, characterize cell behavior changes following ICI, and identify genomic features associated with relevant clinical phenomena. Overall, our study describes the liquid LMD tumor microenvironment prior to and following ICI treatment and demonstrates clinical utility of cell-free and single-cell genomic measurements for LMD research.",
Single-cell RNA sequencing shows the immunosuppressive landscape and tumor heterogeneity of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma,"Daniel Wai-Hung Ho, Yu-Man Tsui, Lo-Kong Chan, Karen Man-Fong Sze, Xin Zhang, Jacinth Wing-Sum Cheu, Yung-Tuen Chiu, Joyce Man-Fong Lee, Albert Chi-Yan Chan, Elaine Tin-Yan Cheung, Derek Tsz-Wai Yau, Nam-Hung Chia, Irene Lai-Oi Lo, Pak-Chung Sham, Tan-To Cheung, Carmen Chak-Lui Wong, Irene Oi-Lin Ng",2021-06-17,"Interaction between tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment is important in cancer development. Immune cells interact with the tumor cells to shape this process. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing analysis to delineate the immune landscape and tumor heterogeneity in a cohort of patients with HBV-associated human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We found that tumor-associated macrophages suppress tumor T cell infiltration and TIGIT-NECTIN2 interaction regulates the immunosuppressive environment. The cell state transition of immune cells towards a more immunosuppressive and exhaustive status exemplifies the overall cancer-promoting immunocellular landscape. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of global molecular profiles reveals co-existence of intra-tumoral and inter-tumoral heterogeneity, but is more apparent in the latter. This analysis of the immunosuppressive landscape and intercellular interactions provides mechanistic information for the design of efficacious immune-oncology treatments in hepatocellular carcinoma.",
Growth differentiation factor 1-induced tumour plasticity provides a therapeutic window for immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Wei Cheng, Hao-Long Li, Shao-Yan Xi, Xiao-Feng Zhang, Yun Zhu, Le Xing, Yan-Xuan Mo, Mei-Mei Li, Fan-En Kong, Wen-Jie Zhu, Xiao-Gang Chen, Hui-Qing Cui, Zhi-Ming Cao, Yuan-Feng Gong, Yun-Qiang Tang, Yan Zhang, Xin-Yuan Guan, Ning-Fang Ma, Ming Liu",2021-12-08,"Tumour lineage plasticity is an emerging hallmark of aggressive tumours. Tumour cells usually hijack developmental signalling pathways to gain cellular plasticity and evade therapeutic targeting. In the present study, the secreted protein growth and differentiation factor 1 (GDF1) is found to be closely associated with poor tumour differentiation. Overexpression of GDF1 suppresses cell proliferation but strongly enhances tumour dissemination and metastasis. Ectopic expression of GDF1 can induce the dedifferentiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells into their ancestral lineages and reactivate a broad panel of cancer testis antigens (CTAs), which further stimulate the immunogenicity of HCC cells to immune-based therapies. Mechanistic studies reveal that GDF1 functions through the Activin receptor-like kinase 7 (ALK7)-Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2/3 (SMAD2/3) signalling cascade and suppresses the epigenetic regulator Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) to boost CTA expression. GDF1-induced tumour lineage plasticity might be an Achilles heel for HCC immunotherapy. Inhibition of LSD1 based on GDF1 biomarker prescreening might widen the therapeutic window for immune checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic.",
A prospective 10-year follow-up study after sublobar resection for ground-glass opacity-dominant lung cancer,"Hirohisa Kato, Satoshi Shiono, Hiroyuki Suzuki, Hidetaka Uramoto, Jiro Abe, Sumiko Maeda, Tohru Hasumi, Hiroyuki Deguchi, Makoto Endo, Nobuyuki Sato, Masaya Aoki, Jotaro Shibuya, Motoyasu Sagawa, Hirotsugu Notsuda, Yoshinori Okada",2024-09-11,"This single-arm multi-institutional prospective study aimed to evaluate the 10-year outcomes of sublobar resection for small-sized ground-glass opacity-dominant lung cancer. Among 73 patients prospectively enrolled from 13 institutions between November 2006 and April 2012, 53 ground-glass opacity-dominant lung cancer patients underwent sublobar resection with wedge resection as the first choice. The inclusion criteria were maximum tumor size of 8–20 mm; ≥ 80% ground-glass opacity ratio on high-resolution computed tomography; lower 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation than the mediastinum; intraoperative pathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in situ; and no cancer cells on intraoperative cut margins. The primary endpoint was a 10-year disease-specific survival. The 53 eligible patients had a mean tumor size of 14 ± 3.4 mm and a mean ground-glass opacity ratio of 95.9 ± 7.2%. Wedge resection and segmentectomy were performed in 39 and 14 patients, respectively. The final pathological diagnoses were adenocarcinoma in situ in 47 patients (88.7%) and adenocarcinoma with mixed subtype in 6 patients (11.3%). The 10-year disease-specific survival and overall survival were 100% and 96.2%, respectively, during a median follow-up period of 120 months (range, 37–162 months). Ground-glass opacity-dominant small lung cancer is cured by sublobar resection when patients are strictly selected by the inclusion criteria of this study.","Sublobar resection, Lung cancer, Ground-glass opacity, Positron emission tomography, Computed tomography"
Differential tumor protein expression at follicular lymphoma diagnosis reveals dysregulation of key molecular pathways associated with histological transformation,"Marie Hairing Enemark, Katharina Wolter, Trine Engelbrecht Hybel, Maja Dam Andersen, Emma Frasez Sørensen, Linnea Meier Hindkaer, Kristina Lystlund Lauridsen, Charlotte Madsen, Trine Lindhardt Plesner, Stephen Hamilton-Dutoit, Bent Honoré, Maja Ludvigsen",2024-12-02,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common low-grade lymphoma. Despite its indolent nature, FL carries an inherent risk of histological transformation (HT) to a more aggressive lymphoma. Existing biomarkers are insufficient to predict HT, indicating the need for more robust biological predictors. Previously, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to identify differentially expressed proteins in diagnostic FLs with and without subsequent HT. This study sought to further investigate identified proteins in transformation of FL, generally acting in important cellular pathways such as (i) apoptosis (BID), (ii) cell cycle (CDC26, CDK6, SRSF1, SRSF2), (iii) GTPase signaling (IQGAP2, MEK1), (iv) cytoskeletal rearrangement and cellular migration (ACTB, CD11a, MMP9, SEPT6), and (v) immune processes (CD81, IgG, MPO, PIK3AP1). We analyzed pre-therapeutic samples from 48 FL patients, either non-transforming FL (nt-FL, n = 30) or subsequently-transforming FL (st-FL, n = 18), the latter with histologically-confirmed transformation after their initial FL diagnosis. Paired high-grade lymphomas (tFL, n = 18) from the time of transformation were also analyzed. We used immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis to quantify protein levels. In all five pathway classes, several proteins were differentially expressed between either the diagnostic nt-FL and st-FL samples, or between the paired st-FL and tFL samples (p < 0.05). Interestingly, we found correlation between expression levels of several proteins, indicating a complex involvement between several pathways. Differential expression of most proteins was also associated with shorter transformation-free survival (p < 0.05). These findings emphasize underlying differences in FL biology predictive of subsequent transformation, highlighting deregulation of important interconnected cellular pathways.","Follicular lymphoma, Histological transformation, Proteomics"
Exploring an novel diagnostic gene of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity based on bioinformatics and machine learning,"Jixiang Pei, Luxin Feng, Qiang Mu, Qitang Wang, Ziying Wu, Zhimei Wang, Yukun Liu",2024-12-03,"Trastuzumab (Tra)-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC) is a serious side effect of cancer chemotherapy, which can seriously harm the health of cancer patients. However, there is currently a lack of effective and reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis of TIC in clinical practice. Therefore, we screened the TIC candidate diagnostic gene solute carrier family 6 member 6 (SLC6A6) by combining multi-machine learning algorithm based on bioinformatics. In addition, cross-validation showed that SLC6A6 had a consistent expression trend in multi-data-sets. To further explore the diagnostic capability of SLC6A6 in TIC, we constructed a nomogram diagnostic model based on SLC6A6 expression level, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve and decision curve analysis proved that SLC6A6 had good diagnostic capability. In order to further verify the TIC expression of SLC6A6 in the real world, we have constructed cell and animal models. Animal experiments showed that left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly decreased (from 65.01 ± 3.30% and 351.32 ± 3.51%, p < 0.0001) after Tra injection, and severe cardiac function was impaired. Similarly, RT-QPCR demonstrated that SLC6A6 was significantly downregulated in Tra-treated cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo. Our study suggests that the differential expression of SLC6A6 in vitro and in vivo models is associated with TIC, which may be a candidate diagnostic gene for the early occurrence and development of TIC and a potential therapeutic target.","Trastuzumab, Cardiotoxicity, Bioinformatics, Machine learning, Biomarkers, SLC6A6"
Using parenclitic networks on phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma tumours provides novel insights on global DNA methylation,"Dimitria Brempou, Bertille Montibus, Louise Izatt, Cynthia L Andoniadou, Rebecca J Oakey",2024-12-02,"Despite the prevalence of sequencing data in biomedical research, the methylome remains underrepresented. Given the importance of DNA methylation in gene regulation and disease, it is crucial to address the need for reliable differential methylation methods. This work presents a novel, transferable approach for extracting information from DNA methylation data. Our agnostic, graph-based pipeline overcomes the limitations of commonly used differential methylation techniques and addresses the “small n, big k” problem. Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PPGL) tumours with known genetic aetiologies experience extreme hypermethylation genome wide. To highlight the effectiveness of our method in candidate discovery, we present the first phenotypic classifier of PPGLs based on DNA methylation achieving 0.7 ROC-AUC. Each sample is represented by an optimised parenclitic network, a graph representing the deviation of the sample’s DNA methylation from the expected non-aggressive patterns. By extracting meaningful topological features, the dimensionality and, hence, the risk of overfitting is reduced, and the samples can be classified effectively. By using an explainable classification method, in this case logistic regression, the key CG loci influencing the decision can be identified. Our work provides insights into the molecular signature of aggressive PPGLs and we propose candidates for further research. Our optimised parenclitic network implementation improves the potential utility of DNA methylation data and offers an effective and complete pipeline for studying such datasets.","Classification, Graph theory, DNA methylation, Phenotype, PPGL, Tumour"
Finite-element analysis of different fixation types after Enneking II + III pelvic tumor resection,"Yu Sun, Haowen Xue, Xiaonan Wang, Jiaxin Zhang, Zezhou Xu, Yunting Guo, Renlong Xin, Zhenglei Yu, Qing Han, Xin Zhao, Jincheng Wang, Luquan Ren",2024-09-06,"The current primary treatment approach for malignant pelvic tumors involves hemipelvic prosthesis reconstruction following tumor resection. In cases of Enneking type II + III pelvic tumors, the prosthesis necessitates fixation to the remaining iliac bone. Prevailing methods for prosthesis fixation include the saddle prosthesis, ice cream prosthesis, modular hemipelvic prosthesis, and personalized prosthetics using three-dimensional printing. To prevent failure of hemipelvic arthroplasty protheses, a novel fixation method was designed and finite element analysis was conducted. In clinical cases, the third and fourth sacral screws broke, a phenomenon also observed in the results of finite element analysis. Based on the original surgical model, designs were created for auxiliary dorsal iliac, auxiliary iliac bottom, auxiliary sacral screw, and auxiliary pubic ramus fixation. A nonlinear quasi-static finite element analysis was then performed under the maximum load of the gait cycle, and the results indicated that assisted sacral dorsal fixation significantly reduces stress on the sacral screws and relative micromotion exceeding 28 μm. The fixation of the pubic ramus further increased the initial stability of the prosthesis and its interface osseointegration ability. Therefore, for hemipelvic prostheses, incorporating pubic ramus support and iliac back fixation is advisable, as it provides new options for the application of hemipelvic tumor prostheses.","Malignant, Pelvic tumor, Prosthesis, Finite element analysis"
"miR-449, identified through antiandrogen exposure, mitigates functional biomarkers associated with ovarian cancer risk","Xia Wang, Ho-Hyung Woo, Michelle Wei, Steven Gibson, Mitzi Miranda, Demaretta Rush, Janiel Cragun, Wenxin Zheng, Guang Yao, Setsuko K. Chambers",2024-12-02,"The involvement of the androgen receptor (AR) pathway in developing epithelial ovarian cancer is increasingly acknowledged. However, the specific mechanisms by which anti-androgen agents, such as flutamide, may prevent ovarian cancer and their efficacy remain unknown. This study was initiated by investigating the impact of flutamide on miRNA expression in women at high risk (HR) for ovarian cancer. Ovarian and tubal tissues, free from ovarian, tubal, peritoneal cancers, and serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), were collected from untreated and flutamide-treated HR women as well as low-risk (LR) women controls. We performed miRNA sequencing on these 3 sample cohorts and observed that flutamide normalized miRNA levels in HR tissues, notably upregulating the miR-449 family to levels seen in LR tissues. In subsequent tests in primary ovarian epithelial cells and ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and Hey), flutamide also increased miR-449a and miR-449b-5p levels. Introducing mimics of these miRNAs reduced the mRNA and protein levels of AR and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R, also known as c-fms), both of which are known contributors to ovarian cancer progression, with emerging evidence also supporting their roles in ovarian cancer initiation. Ovarian cancer cell migration was inhibited upon introducing miR-449a and miR-449b-5p mimics. Together, our study suggests a novel dual-inhibitory mechanism of flutamide on the AR pathway (AR expression suppression in addition to direct androgen antagonism) and supports its chemopreventive potential in ovarian cancer, especially for HR patients with low miR-449 expression.","MicroRNA, CSF1R, Androgen receptor, Flutamide, Ovarian cancer risk"
The Prognostic Value of Nodal Staging in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer — A Cohort from China,"Liu Yin, Hao Shuang, Chen Sheng, Huang Liang, Xiang-Jie Sun, Wen-Tao Yang, Zhi-Ming Shao",2018-06-13,"To evaluate the clinical outcomes and relationship between tumor size, lymph node status, and prognosis in a large cohort of patients with triple–negative breast cancer (TNBC).849 Patients were categorized by tumor size and nodal status. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association of nodal status and tumor size with survival outcomes. A Sidak adjustment was used for pairwise group comparisons. We conducted six pairwise comparisons between different node status. In univariate and multivariate analyses, it was indicated that N0 patients had similar prognoses as N1 patients (P = 0.072), and the OS of both of these groups was significantly better than that of N2/N3 patients (N0 vs N2, P < 0.001; N0 vs N3, P < 0.001; N1 vs N2, P = 0.014; N1 vs N3, P = 0.005). In summary, we report that in Chinese patients with triple-negative breast cancer, a greater difference in survival was observed between N1 and N2 than between N0 and N1, warranting the possible need of more intensive chemotherapy for N2-3 patients. We also found that tumor size made an impact on survival when lymph nodes were extensively involved, a finding that needs longer follow-up and further validation.",
Multifaceted impact of HIV inhibitor dapivirine on triple negative breast cancer cells reveals potential entities as targets for novel therapy,"Ketki Patil, Elizabeth Johnston, Joseph Novack, Garrett Wallace, Michelle Lin, S. Balakrishna Pai",2024-12-03,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Many breast cancers originate from the cells lining the milk duct and some become invasive. Breast cancer lacking estrogen, progesterone receptors (ER-, PR-) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-) amplification, termed “Triple negative” (TNBC) is reported to frequently affect Black women and younger women. TNBC is an invasive ductal carcinoma with limited treatment options. To this end, we opted to investigate drugs that could be repurposed because they offer advantages in bringing effective treatments faster to the clinic. We chose to study the effect of the drug, dapivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) of HIV because it could be detected in the breast milk of lactating women when treated for HIV and the drug could potentially target the cancer. Here we show the potent impact of dapivirine on MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells, while NNRTI like nevirapine showed marginal effects. When dapivirine was tested on other breast cell lines, MCF-7 and MCF 10A, the inhibition was at higher concentrations. Molecular studies with dapivirine in TNBC cells, revealed an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptotic cells, and activation of caspases. Importantly, protein profiling and STRING analysis revealed deregulation of the key molecule, PCNA and impact on pivotal cell signaling circuits including extracellular matrix (ECM), angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and immunomodulation. Of note, is its potential effect on stem-like cells due to downregulation of the basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3) and proteasome activator complex subunit 3; the latter affecting their dependence on the proteasome pathway. Taken together, dapivirine exhibits the potential to be considered as a repurposed drug for TNBC as monotherapy/combination therapy. Notably, it could also potentially be a treatment for individuals with dual ailments, such as HIV and TNBC, if the clinical outcomes with dapivirine for TNBC become favorable.","Triple negative breast cancer, Dapivirine, MDA-MB-231, Apoptosis, Proteomics, Multicaspase"
SLC13A3 is a major effector downstream of activated β-catenin in liver cancer pathogenesis,"Wennan Zhao, Xue Wang, Lifeng Han, Chunze Zhang, Chenxi Wang, Dexin Kong, Mingzhe Zhang, Tong Xu, Gen Li, Ge Hu, Jiahua Luo, Sook Wah Yee, Jia Yang, Andreas Stahl, Xin Chen, Youcai Zhang",2024-08-30,"Activated Wnt/β-catenin pathway is a key genetic event in liver cancer development. Solute carrier (SLC) transporters are promising drug targets. Here, we identify SLC13A3 as a drug-targetable effector downstream of β-catenin in liver cancer. SLC13A3 expression is elevated in human liver cancer samples with gain of function (GOF) mutant CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin. Activation of β-catenin up-regulates SLC13A3, leading to intracellular accumulation of endogenous SLC13A3 substrates. SLC13A3 is identified as a low-affinity transporter for glutathione (GSH). Silencing of SLC13A3 downregulates the leucine transporter SLC7A5 via c-MYC signaling, leading to leucine depletion and mTOR inactivation. Furthermore, silencing of SLC13A3 depletes GSH and induces autophagic ferroptosis in β-catenin-activated liver cancer cells. Importantly, both genetic inhibition of SLC13A3 and a small molecule SLC13A3 inhibitor suppress β-catenin-driven hepatocarcinogenesis in mice. Altogether, our study suggests that SLC13A3 could be a promising therapeutic target for treating human liver cancers with GOF CTNNB1 mutations.",

De Marzo, Srinivasan Yegnasubramanian",2024-08-28,"How prostate cancer cells and their precursors mediate changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to drive prostate cancer progression is unclear, in part due to the inability to longitudinally study the disease evolution in human tissues. To overcome this limitation, we perform extensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and molecular pathology of the comparative biology between human prostate cancer and key stages in the disease evolution of a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of prostate cancer. Our studies of human tissues reveal that cancer cell-intrinsic activation of MYC signaling is a common denominator across the well-known molecular and pathological heterogeneity of human prostate cancer. Cell communication network and pathway analyses in GEMMs show that MYC oncogene-expressing neoplastic cells, directly and indirectly, reprogram the TME during carcinogenesis, leading to a convergence of cell state alterations in neighboring epithelial, immune, and fibroblast cell types that parallel key findings in human prostate cancer.",
Inhibition of TOPORS ubiquitin ligase augments the efficacy of DNA hypomethylating agents through DNMT1 stabilization,"Satoshi Kaito, Kazumasa Aoyama, Motohiko Oshima, Akiho Tsuchiya, Makiko Miyota, Masayuki Yamashita, Shuhei Koide, Yaeko Nakajima-Takagi, Hiroko Kozuka-Hata, Masaaki Oyama, Takao Yogo, Tomohiro Yabushita, Ryoji Ito, Masaya Ueno, Atsushi Hirao, Kaoru Tohyama, Chao Li, Kimihito Cojin Kawabata, Kiyoshi Yamaguchi, Yoichi Furukawa, Hidetaka Kosako, Akihide Yoshimi, Susumu Goyama, Yasuhito Nannya, Seishi Ogawa, Karl Agger, Kristian Helin, Satoshi Yamazaki, Haruhiko Koseki, Noriko Doki, Yuka Harada, Hironori Harada, Atsuya Nishiyama, Makoto Nakanishi, Atsushi Iwama",2024-08-28,"DNA hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are used for the treatment of myeloid malignancies, although their therapeutic effects have been unsatisfactory. Here we show that CRISPR-Cas9 screening reveals that knockout of topoisomerase 1-binding arginine/serine-rich protein (TOPORS), which encodes a ubiquitin/SUMO E3 ligase, augments the efficacy of HMAs on myeloid leukemic cells with little effect on normal hematopoiesis, suggesting that TOPORS is involved in resistance to HMAs. HMAs are incorporated into the DNA and trap DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) to form DNA-DNMT1 crosslinks, which undergo SUMOylation, followed by proteasomal degradation. Persistent crosslinking is cytotoxic. The TOPORS RING finger domain, which mediates ubiquitination, is responsible for HMA resistance. In TOPORS knockout cells, DNMT1 is stabilized by HMA treatment due to inefficient ubiquitination, resulting in the accumulation of unresolved SUMOylated DNMT1. This indicates that TOPORS ubiquitinates SUMOylated DNMT1, thereby promoting the resolution of DNA-DNMT1 crosslinks. Consistently, the ubiquitination inhibitor, TAK-243, and the SUMOylation inhibitor, TAK-981, show synergistic effects with HMAs through DNMT1 stabilization. Our study provides a novel HMA-based therapeutic strategy that interferes with the resolution of DNA-DNMT1 crosslinks.",
Smac/DIABLO protein acts as an independent prognostic factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma,"Fábio França Vieira e Silva, Vito Carlo Alberto Caponio, Andrea Ballini, Cintia Micaela Chamorro-Petronacci, Alejandro Ismael Lourenzo-Pouso, Abel García-García, Marina Di Domenico, José Manuel Suaréz-Peñaranda, Mario Pérez-Sayáns, María Elena Padín-Iruegas",2024-12-03,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) poses significant health risks with increasing incidence and mortality rates. In this context, there is an urgent need to explore novel biomarkers to enhance therapeutic strategies and improve survival. Understanding apoptotic evasion in cancer pathogenesis, this pioneering study aims to investigate the correlation between a pro-apoptotic protein Smac/DIABLO and patient prognosis within the OSCC cohort. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to analyze Smac/DIABLO protein expression and correlate with clinicopathological and prognostic factors during a long-term follow-up. Smac/DIABLO low expression was associated with worse overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and an increase in risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM) in univariate analyses. Furthermore, multivariate analyses confirmed Smac/DIABLO as an independent prognostic factor, predicting poorer OS [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 3.6 (95% CI 1.7–7.6), p < 0.001], RFS [HR = 2.9 (95% CI 1.4–5.6), p = 0.003], DSS [HR = 6.7 (95% CI 2.7–16.7), p < 0.001], and increased likelihood of LNM [Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.8 (95% CI 1.4–15.9), p = 0.011]. Patients with positive Smac/DIABLO expression exhibited three times higher survival probability. Low proapoptotic protein Smac/DIABLO expression significantly influences prognostic predictions and strongly correlates with poor OSCC outcomes. Future studies involving Smac-mimetic drugs in OSCC are needed to evaluate their pro-apoptotic potential in cancer cells.","Oral squamous cell carcinoma, Apoptosis, Smac/DIABLO, Smac-Mimetics Therapy"

However, the heterogeneous form of data and uneven distribution of targets make drug discovery and precision medicine a non-trivial task. This study takes pyroptosis therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a paradigm and uses data mining of a large TNBC cohort and drug databases to establish a biofactor-regulated neural network for rapidly screening and optimizing compound pyroptosis drug pairs. Subsequently, biomimetic nanococrystals are prepared using the preferred combination of mitoxantrone and gambogic acid for rational drug delivery. The unique mechanism of obtained nanococrystals regulating pyroptosis genes through ribosomal stress and triggering pyroptosis cascade immune effects are revealed in TNBC models. In this work, a target omics-based intelligent compound drug discovery framework explores an innovative drug development paradigm, which repurposes existing drugs and enables precise treatment of refractory diseases.",
Accurate prediction of colorectal cancer diagnosis using machine learning based on immunohistochemistry pathological images,"Bobin Ning, Jimei Chi, Qingyu Meng, Baoqing Jia",2024-12-02,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most prevalent tumor and the second leading cause of mortality. Early and accurate diagnosis holds significant importance in enhancing patient treatment and prognosis. Machine learning technology and bioinformatics have provided novel approaches for cancer diagnosis. This study aims to develop a CRC diagnostic model based on immunohistochemical staining image features using machine learning methods. Initially, CRC disease-specific genes were identified through bioinformatics analysis, SVM-RFE and Random Forest algorithm utilizing RNA-seq data from both GEO and TCGA databases. Subsequently, verification of these genes was performed using proteomics data from CPTAC and HPA database, resulting in identification of target proteins (AKR1B10, CA2, DHRS9, and ZG16) for further investigation. SVM and CNN were then employed to analyze and integrate the characteristics of immunohistochemical images to construct a reliable CRC diagnostic model. During the training and validation process of this model, cross-validation along with external validation methods were implemented to ensure accuracy and reliability. The results demonstrate that the established diagnostic model exhibits excellent performance in distinguishing between CRC and normal controls (accuracy rate: 0.999), thereby presenting potential prospects for clinical application. These findings are expected to provide innovative perspectives as well as methodologies for personalized diagnosis of CRC while offering more precise references for promising treatment.","Colorectal cancer, Diagnosis, Machine learning, Immunohistochemistry"
Clinical Application of Artificial Ascites in assisting CT-guided Percutaneous Cryoablation of Hepatic Tumors Adjacent to the Gastrointestinal Tract,"Bing Li, Chuan Liu, Xiao-Xue Xu, Yang Li, Yong Du, Chuan Zhang, Hou-Jun Zheng, Han-Feng Yang",2017-11-30,"This study was to assess the safety and efficacy of artificial ascitetes in assisting CT-guided cryoablation of hepatic tumors adjacent to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A total of 84 patients with peripheral hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract, who were treated cryoablation, were included in this retrospective study. Of these 84 patients, cryoablation had been performed in 39 patients with 41 peripheral hepatic tumors. These were assisted by induction artificial ascites while 40 patients with 43 peripheral hepatic tumors underwent cryoablation without induction of ascites. The artificial ascites separation success rate, the cryoablation technique effectiveness, local tumor progression and complications were all evaluated. The results showed that the artificial ascites separation success rate for 41 hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract was 95% (39/41). Technique effectiveness of group I was achieved in 35 of 43 tumors (81.3%) after follow-up imaging three months after cryoablation. In group II, technique effectiveness was achieved in 39 of 41 tumors after follow-up imaging three months following cryoablation. No major complications were encountered in either of the two groups. Artificial ascites assisting in CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation is a reliable and effective method for the treatment of hepatic tumors adjacent to the GI tract, and it can achieve a fine local control of such tumors.",

Genetic alteration screening for all ICC patients is of high cost and not routinely performed. This study intends to develop a histopathology-based artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted system for predicting genetic alteration of ICC.MethodsWe constructed a Genetic Alteration Prediction (GAP) system based on multi-instance learning and self-supervised learning to predict genetic alterations using whole-slide images (WSIs) of H&E-stained slides. A total of 2069 WSIs from 232 ICC patients underwent surgery of the FAH-SYSU dataset were used for model construction and adjustment by five-fold cross-validation. Another 150 patients from three medical centres were used as independent external validations. We also compared the cost-effectiveness of GAP-assisted precise treatment and all-sequencing strategy to non-sequencing strategy.ResultsThe GAP was able to predict actionable genetic alterations of ICC, including FGFR2 and IDH. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for FGFR2 and IDH were 0.754 and 0.713 in the internal dataset, and 0.724 and 0.656 in the external dataset, respectively. Furthermore, compared to giving chemotherapy without sequencing for every patient, GAP-assisted precise treatment could increase 1 progression-free quality-adjusted life month with a cost of $13871.72, the co-responding figure for all-sequencing strategy is $44538.93. Decision curve analysis showed that AI-assisted strategy provides better clinical benefits.ConclusionsWe constructed an AI-assisted genetic alteration screening system which is predictable to ICC actionable targets and has potential to assist precise targeted treatment of advanced ICC.",

Berdan, Shannan Ho Sui, Matthew R. Ramsey, Steven R. Barthel, Tobias Schatton",2024-08-26,"Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) is a premier cancer drug target for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Because PD-1 receptor inhibition activates tumor-specific T-cell immunity, research has predominantly focused on T-cell-PD-1 expression and its immunobiology. In contrast, cancer cell-intrinsic PD-1 functional regulation is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate induction of PD-1 in melanoma cells via type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling and reversal of ICB efficacy through IFNAR pathway inhibition. Treatment of melanoma cells with IFN-α or IFN-β triggers IFNAR-mediated Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling, increases chromatin accessibility and resultant STAT1/2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) binding within a PD-1 gene enhancer, and leads to PD-1 induction. IFNAR1 or JAK/STAT inhibition suppresses melanoma-PD-1 expression and disrupts ICB efficacy in preclinical models. Our results uncover type I IFN-dependent regulation of cancer cell-PD-1 and provide mechanistic insight into the potential unintended ICB-neutralizing effects of widely used IFNAR1 and JAK inhibitors.",

In this single-arm, phase II study with Simon’s two-stage design, we investigated the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant camrelizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with early TNBC (NCT04213898). Eligible female patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed treatment-naïve early TNBC were treated with camrelizumab (200 mg, on day 1), nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2, on days 1, 8, and 15), and epirubicin (75 mg/m2, on day 1) every three weeks for six cycles. The primary end point was the pathological complete response; secondary endpoints included safety, objective response rate, and long-term survival outcomes of event-free survival, disease-free survival, and distant disease-free survival. A total of 39 patients were enrolled between January 2020 and October 2021. Twenty-five patients achieved a pathological complete response (64.1%, 95%CI: 47.2, 78.8). The objective response rate was 89.7% (95%CI: 74.8, 96.7), including 35 patients with partial responses. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 30 (76.9%) patients.

Single cell transcriptomic profiling identifies tumor-acquired and therapy-resistant cell states in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma,"Sara G. Danielli, Yun Wei, Michael A. Dyer, Elizabeth Stewart, Heather Sheppard, Marco Wachtel, Beat W. Schäfer, Anand G. Patel, David M. Langenau",2024-07-26,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a pediatric tumor that resembles undifferentiated muscle cells; yet the extent to which cell state heterogeneity is shared with human development has not been described. Using single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing from patient tumors, patient-derived xenografts, primary in vitro cultures, and cell lines, we identify four dominant muscle-lineage cell states: progenitor, proliferative, differentiated, and ground cells. We stratify these RMS cells/nuclei along the continuum of human muscle development and show that they share expression patterns with fetal/embryonal myogenic precursors rather than postnatal satellite cells. Fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) have a discrete stem cell hierarchy that recapitulates fetal muscle development and contain therapy-resistant FN-RMS progenitors that share transcriptomic similarity with bipotent skeletal mesenchymal cells. Fusion-positive RMS have tumor-acquired cells states, including a neuronal cell state, that are not found in myogenic development. This work identifies previously underappreciated cell state heterogeneity including unique treatment-resistant and tumor-acquired cell states that differ across RMS subtypes.",
Development and validation of a clinical predictive model for high-volume lymph node metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma,"Hanlin Zhu, Haifeng Zhang, Peiying Wei, Tong Zhang, Chunfeng Hu, Huijun Cao, Zhijiang Han",2024-07-09,"The central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) status in the cervical region serves as a pivotal determinant for the extent of surgical intervention and prognosis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). This paper seeks to devise and validate a predictive model based on clinical parameters for the early anticipation of high-volume CLNM (hv-CLNM, > 5 nodes) in high-risk patients. A retrospective analysis of the pathological and clinical data of patients with PTC who underwent surgical treatment at Medical Centers A and B was conducted. The data from Center A was randomly divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio, with those from Center B serving as the test set. Multifactor logistic regression was harnessed in the training set to select variables and construct a predictive model. The generalization ability of the model was assessed in the validation and test sets. The model was evaluated through the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) to predict the efficiency of hv-CLNM. The goodness of fit of the model was examined via the Brier verification technique. The incidence of hv-CLNM in 5897 PTC patients attained 4.8%. The occurrence rates in males and females were 9.4% (128/1365) and 3.4% (156/4532), respectively. Multifactor logistic regression unraveled male gender (OR = 2.17, p < .001), multifocality (OR = 4.06, p < .001), and lesion size (OR = 1.08 per increase of 1 mm, p < .001) as risk factors, while age emerged as a protective factor (OR = 0.95 per an increase of 1 year, p < .001). The model constructed with four predictive variables within the training set exhibited an AUC of 0.847 ([95%CI] 0.815–0.878). In the validation and test sets, the AUCs were 0.831 (0.783–0.879) and 0.845 (0.789–0.901), respectively, with Brier scores of 0.037, 0.041, and 0.056. Subgroup analysis unveiled AUCs for the prediction model in PTC lesion size groups (≤ 10 mm and > 10 mm) as 0.803 (0.757–0.85) and 0.747 (0.709–0.785), age groups (≤ 31 years and > 31 years) as 0.778 (0.720–0.881) and 0.837 (0.806–0.867), multifocal and solitary cases as 0.803 (0.767–0.838) and 0.809 (0.769–0.849), and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and non-HT cases as 0.845 (0.793–0.897) and 0.845 (0.819–0.871). Male gender, multifocality, and larger lesion size are risk factors for hv-CLNM in PTC patients, whereas age serves as a protective factor. The clinical predictive model developed in this research facilitates the early identification of high-risk patients for hv-CLNM, thereby assisting physicians in more efficacious risk stratification management for PTC patients.","Papillary thyroid carcinoma, Central lymph node metastasis, High volume, Clinical predictive model"
Spatial transcriptomics reveals niche-specific enrichment and vulnerabilities of radial glial stem-like cells in malignant gliomas,"Yanming Ren, Zongyao Huang, Lingling Zhou, Peng Xiao, Junwei Song, Ping He, Chuanxing Xie, Ran Zhou, Menghan Li, Xiangqun Dong, Qing Mao, Chao You, Jianguo Xu, Yanhui Liu, Zhigang Lan, Tiejun Zhang, Qi Gan, Yuan Yang, Tengyun Chen, Bowen Huang, Xiang Yang, Anqi Xiao, Yun Ou, Zhengzheng Su, Lu Chen, Yan Zhang, Yan Ju, Yuekang Zhang, Yuan Wang",2023-02-23,"Diffuse midline glioma-H3K27M mutant (DMG) and glioblastoma (GBM) are the most lethal brain tumors that primarily occur in pediatric and adult patients, respectively. Both tumors exhibit significant heterogeneity, shaped by distinct genetic/epigenetic drivers, transcriptional programs including RNA splicing, and microenvironmental cues in glioma niches. However, the spatial organization of cellular states and niche-specific regulatory programs remain to be investigated. Here, we perform a spatial profiling of DMG and GBM combining short- and long-read spatial transcriptomics, and single-cell transcriptomic datasets. We identify clinically relevant transcriptional programs, RNA isoform diversity, and multi-cellular ecosystems across different glioma niches. We find that while the tumor core enriches for oligodendrocyte precursor-like cells, radial glial stem-like (RG-like) cells are enriched in the neuron-rich invasive niche in both DMG and GBM. Further, we identify niche-specific regulatory programs for RG-like cells, and functionally confirm that FAM20C mediates invasive growth of RG-like cells in a neuron-rich microenvironment in a human neural stem cell derived orthotopic DMG model. Together, our results provide a blueprint for understanding the spatial architecture and niche-specific vulnerabilities of DMG and GBM.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the SEER database. Patients with cT2N0 MS-SCC were included in the study and divided into two groups: those who received END and those who did not. The impact of END on disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed using propensity score matching. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors for occult metastasis. A total of 180 patients were included in the study, with 40 cases receiving END. Following propensity score matching, patients treated with END and those without showed similar DSS and OS rates. Occult metastasis was observed in 9 patients, corresponding to a rate of 22.5%. High-grade tumors were independently associated with a higher risk of occult metastasis compared to low-grade tumors (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.17–2.00). cT2 MS-SCC carries an occult metastasis rate of 22.5%, with histologic grade being the primary determinant of occult metastasis. END does not confer a significant survival benefit in this patient population.","Maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma, Elective neck dissection, Occult metastasis, Survival, PSM"
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors use and risk for mortality and metastases among male patients with colorectal cancer,"Wuqing Huang, Jan Sundquist, Kristina Sundquist, Jianguang Ji",2020-06-24,"Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors are suggested to have anti-tumor effects and to inhibit surgery-induced immunosuppression. We aimed to explore whether post-diagnostic use of PDE5 inhibitors was associated with a better prognosis among male patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and the role of open surgery in the association. Here we show that post-diagnostic use of PDE5 inhibitors is associated with a decreased risk of CRC-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.67-0.99) as well as a decreased risk of metastasis (adjusted HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.98). Specifically, post-operative use of PDE5 inhibitors has a strong anti-cancer effect. The reduced risk of metastasis is mainly due to distant metastasis but not regional lymphatic metastasis. PDE5 inhibitors have the potential to be an adjuvant drug for patients with CRC to improve prognosis, especially those who have undergone open surgery.",

A telomere-targeting drug depletes cancer initiating cells and promotes anti-tumor immunity in small cell lung cancer,"Buse Eglenen-Polat, Ryan R.

Akbay",2024-01-22,"There are few effective treatments for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) underscoring the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. This study focuses on exploiting telomerase, a critical SCLC dependency as a therapeutic target. A prominent characteristic of SCLC is their reliance on telomerase activity, a key enzyme essential for their continuous proliferation. Here we utilize a nucleoside analog, 6-Thio-2’-deoxyguanosine (6TdG) currently in phase II clinical trials, that is preferentially incorporated by telomerase into telomeres leading to telomere dysfunction. Using preclinical mouse and human derived models we find low intermittent doses of 6TdG inhibit tumor growth and reduce metastatic burden. Anti-tumor efficacy correlates with a reduction in a subpopulation of cancer initiating like cells (CICs) identified by their expression of L1CAM/CD133 and highest telomerase activity. 6TdG treatment also leads to activation of innate and adaptive anti-tumor responses. Mechanistically, 6TdG depletes CICs and induces type-I interferon signaling leading to tumor immune visibility by activating tumor cell STING signaling. We also observe increased sensitivity to irradiation after 6TdG treatment in both syngeneic and humanized SCLC xenograft models both of which are dependent on the presence of host immune cells. This study underscores the immune-enhancing and metastasis-reducing effects of 6TdG, employing a range of complementary in vitro and in vivo SCLC preclinical models providing a potential therapeutic approach to SCLC.",
Innovative label-free lymphoma diagnosis using infrared spectroscopy and machine learning on tissue sections,"Charlotte Delrue, Mattias Hofmans, Jo Van Dorpe, Malaïka Van der Linden, Zen Van Gaever, Tessa Kerre, Marijn M. Speeckaert, Sander De Bruyne",2024-10-31,"The diagnosis of lymphomas is challenging due to their diverse histological presentations and clinical manifestations. There is a need for inexpensive tools that require minimal expertise and are accessible for routine laboratories. Contrastingly, current conventional diagnostic methods are often found only in specialized environments. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy offers a nondestructive and user-friendly approach in the analysis of a wide range of samples. In this paper, we determined whether the technique coupled with machine learning can detect and differentiate lymphoma within lymphoid tissue samples. Tissue sections from 295 individuals diagnosed with lymphoma and 389 individuals without the disease were analyzed using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The resulting spectral dataset was split using a 70:30 train-test split. Partial least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models were trained to distinguish non-malignant lymphoid tissue from lymphoma samples and to differentiate between subtypes. On the training set (n = 478), significant spectral differences were mainly identified in the 1800–900 cm–1 region, attributed to fundamental biochemical constituents like proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. On the independent test set (n = 206), the trained PLS-DA model achieved a promising AUC of 0.882 (95% CI: 0.881–0.884) in the differentiation between lymphoma and non-malignant lymphoid tissue. In addition, comparative analyses revealed spectral distinctions and notable clustering between the different lymphoma subtypes. This study provides valuable insights into the application of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and machine learning in the field of lymphoma diagnosis as a non-destructive, rapid and inexpensive tool with the potential to be easily implemented in non-specialized laboratories.",
BRD-810 is a highly selective MCL1 inhibitor with optimized in vivo clearance and robust efficacy in solid and hematological tumor models,"Ulrike Rauh, Guo Wei, Michael Serrano-Wu, Georgios Kosmidis, Stefan Kaulfuss, Franziska Siegel, Kai Thede, James McFarland, Christopher T.

Golub",2024-08-23,"The MCL1 gene is frequently amplified in cancer and codes for the antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1), which confers resistance to the current standard of care. Therefore, MCL1 is an attractive anticancer target. Here we describe BRD-810 as a potent and selective MCL1 inhibitor and its key design principle of rapid systemic clearance to potentially minimize area under the curve-driven toxicities associated with MCL1 inhibition. BRD-810 induced rapid cell killing within 4 h in vitro but, in the same 4-h window, had no impact on cell viability or troponin I release in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, even at suprapharmacologic concentrations. In vivo BRD-810 induced efficacy in xenograft hematological and solid tumor models despite the short residence time of BRD-810 in plasma. In totality, our data support the hypothesis that short-term inhibition of MCL1 with BRD-810 can induce apoptosis in tumor cells while maintaining an acceptable safety profile. We, therefore, intend to advance BRD-810 to clinical trials.",
Temporal dynamics of immune cell patterns in bladder cancer patients receiving Bacillus Calmette-Guérin therapy,"Jiang-Li Lu, Yun-Lin Ye, Dan-Dan Zheng, Xin-Yu Shi, Li-Ling Hu, Xiao-Yi Yuan, Tao-Nong Cai, Kun Meng, Neng-Qiao Wen, Yu-Ying Li, Ding-Kang Wang, Fu-Jin Shi, Dan-Ya Liu, Qing-Yu He, Zi-Ke Qin, Chris Zhiyi Zhang, Yun Cao",2024-10-31,"BackgroundBacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is capable of enhancing the infiltration of immune cells into the tumour. However the temporal dynamics of immune cell patterns in patients receiving BCG instillation remains unclear.MethodsNinety-six patients who underwent intravesical BCG therapy, comprising 46 responders and 50 non-responders, were retrospectively enroled to explore the evolving immune landscape. This study involved a detailed examination of sequential samples collected before, during, and after BCG treatment to assess BCG’s influence on the immune microenvironment, employing techniques such as immunohistochemistry, fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry, and mass spectrometry techniques.ResultsOur study found that initial BCG instillation leads to enhanced immune cell infiltration, correlating with treatment efficacy, with responders exhibiting more pronounced increases. Non-responders experience a rise in immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression during the first instillation, which returns to baseline after treatment. In non-responders, BCG re-challenge fail to further increase immune cell infiltration into the tumour or improve patient outcomes. Strikingly, proteomics data revealed that GBP1 expression was induced by BCG treatment in non-responders.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrated the induction of tumour PD-L1 expression by BCG in non-responders, and therefore provide insights for the combination of BCG and anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 therapy.",
TNF-ɑ induces mitochondrial dysfunction to drive NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis in MCF-7 cells,"Kexin Gao, Yancui Liu, Cheng Sun, Ying Wang, Hongrong Bao, Guoyang Liu, Jinrui Ou, Ping Sun",2024-10-29,"Pyroptosis is a gasdermin-mediated pro-inflammatory form of programmed cell death (PCD). Tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (TNF-ɑ) is an inflammatory cytokine, and some studies have shown that TNF-ɑ can cause pyroptosis of cells and exert anti-tumor effects. However, whether TNF-ɑ exerts anti-tumor effects on breast cancer cells by inducing pyroptosis has not been reported. In this study, to explore the impact of TNF-ɑ on pyroptosis in breast cancer cells, we treated MCF-7 cells with TNF-ɑ and found that TNF-ɑ induced cell death. Moreover, we observed that the dead cells were swollen with obvious balloon-like bubbles, which was a typical sign of pyroptosis. Further studies have found that the anti-tumor effect of TNF-ɑ on breast cancer cells in vitro was achieved through the canonical pyroptosis pathway. In addition, TNF-ɑ-induced pyroptosis in MCF-7 cells was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, in which mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased and mitochondrial ROS production was increased. After inhibiting ROS production, the activation effect of TNF-ɑ on NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway was weakened, and the inhibitory effect of TNF-ɑ on the growth of MCF-7 cells in vitro was also decreased, further confirming the involvement of ROS in TNF-ɑ-induced pyroptosis. Overall, our study revealed a new mechanism by which TNF-ɑ exerts an anti-tumor effect by inducing pyroptosis in MCF-7 cells through the ROS/NLRP3/Caspase-1/GSDMD pathway, which may provide new therapeutic ideas for the treatment of breast cancer.","TNF-ɑ, Pyroptosis, ROS, Breast cancer"

High-risk neuroblastoma is an aggressive pediatric solid tumor that expresses cell-surface GPC2 and GD2 with a tumor microenvironment infiltrated by CD16a-expressing innate immune cells. Here we engineer T-cells to express a GPC2-directed CAR and simultaneously secrete a bispecific innate immune cell engager (BiCE) targeting both GD2 and CD16a. In vitro, GPC2.CAR-GD2.BiCE T-cells induce GPC2-dependent cytotoxicity and secrete GD2.BiCE that promotes GD2-dependent activation of antitumor innate immunity. In vivo, GPC2.CAR-GD2.BiCE T-cells locally deliver GD2.BiCE and increase intratumor retention of NK-cells. In mice bearing neuroblastoma patient-derived xenografts and reconstituted with human CD16a-expressing immune cells, GD2.BiCEs enhance GPC2.CAR antitumor efficacy. A CAR.BiCE strategy should be considered for tumor histologies where antigen escape limits CAR efficacy, especially for solid tumors like neuroblastoma that are infiltrated by innate immune cells.",

As underlying disease mechanisms are not well understood, targeted therapies are lacking. Since fibroblasts are the key mediators of all fibroproliferative diseases, this study aimed to characterize patient-derived fibroblasts to identify therapeutic targets. We studied primary human control and RIM-fibroblasts on a functional and molecular basis, analyzed peripheral blood and tissue samples and conducted, based on our findings, a treatment attempt in one patient. In RIM, we identified a distinct myofibroblast phenotype reflected by increased alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (αSMA) expression, reduced proliferation and migration rates, and overexpression of osteopontin (OPN). Our RNA sequencing identified aberrant Myc activation as a potential disease driver in RIM fibroblasts, similar to previous findings in systemic sclerosis. Treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug mesalazine reversed the myofibroblast phenotype by targeting Myc. Based on these findings, a patient with RIM was successfully treated with mesalazine, resulting in reduced inflammation and pain and tissue softening, while serum OPN was halved. The present study provides a comprehensive characterization of RIM fibroblasts, suggests a disease-driving role for Myc, demonstrates promising antifibrotic effects of mesalazine and proposes OPN as a biomarker for RIM.","Fibrosis, Morphea, Drug repurposing, Breast cancer, Mesalazine"

However, resistance to these therapies due to target absence or antigen shedding limits their efficacy and excludes tumours from candidacy. To address this limitation, here we engineer an oncolytic rhabdovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVΔ51), to express a truncated targeted antigen, which allows for HER2-targeting with trastuzumab. The truncated HER2 (HER2T) lacks signaling capabilities and is efficiently expressed on infected cell surfaces. VSVΔ51-mediated HER2T expression simulates HER2-positive status in tumours, enabling effective treatment with the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Additionally, we combine VSVΔ51-HER2T with an oncolytic vaccinia virus expressing a HER2-targeted T-cell engager. This dual-virus therapeutic strategy demonstrates potent curative efficacy in vivo in female mice using CD3+ infiltrate for anti-tumour immunity. Our findings showcase the ability to tailor the tumour microenvironment using oncolytic viruses, thereby enhancing compatibility with “off-the-shelf” targeted therapies.",

Here, we examine the single-cell transcriptional and TCR profiles of 18 tumor tissues pre- and post- therapy of gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin, in combination with lenvatinib and anti-PD1 antibody for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. We find that high CD8 GZMB+ and CD8 proliferating proportions and a low Macro CD5L+ proportion predict good response to the therapy. In patients with a poor response, the CD8 GZMB+ and CD8 proliferating proportions are increased, but the CD8 GZMK+ proportion is decreased after the therapy. Transition of CD8 proliferating and CD8 GZMB+ to CD8 GZMK+ facilitates good response to the therapy, while Macro CD5L+–CD8 GZMB+ crosstalk impairs the response by increasing CTLA4 in CD8 GZMB+. Anti-CTLA4 antibody reverses resistance of the therapy in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Our data provide a resource for predicting response of the combination therapy and highlight the importance of CD8+T-cell status conversion and exhaustion induced by Macro CD5L+ in influencing the response, suggesting future avenues for cancer treatment optimization.",

Here, we perform metabolomic profiling of 17 tumor-normal pairs; bulk transcriptomics of 263 normal thyroid, 348 papillary, and 21 undifferentiated thyroid cancer samples; and single-cell transcriptomes from 15 cases, showing the impact of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism in thyroid tumors. High expression of serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2) and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) is associated with low thyroid differentiation scores and poor clinical features. A subpopulation of tumor cells with high mitochondrial one-carbon pathway activity is observed in the single-cell dataset. SHMT2 inhibition significantly compromises mitochondrial respiration and decreases cell proliferation and tumor size in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of the mitochondrial one-carbon pathway in undifferentiated thyroid cancer and suggest that SHMT2 is a potent therapeutic target.",

Although enteric glia modulate immune responses in other intestinal diseases, their interaction with the colorectal cancer immune cell compartment remains unclear. Through a combination of single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, both in murine models and patients, here we find that enteric glia acquire an immunomodulatory phenotype by bi-directional communication with tumor-infiltrating monocytes. The latter direct a reactive enteric glial cell phenotypic and functional switch via glial IL-1R signaling. In turn, tumor glia promote monocyte differentiation towards pro-tumorigenic SPP1+ tumor-associated macrophages by IL-6 release. Enteric glia cell abundancy correlates with worse disease outcomes in preclinical models and colorectal cancer patients. Thereby, our study reveals a neuroimmune interaction between enteric glia and tumor-associated macrophages in the colorectal tumor microenvironment, providing insights into colorectal cancer pathogenesis.",

M. Smith, Mallika Singh, Neal Rosen",2024-07-19,"Current KRASG12C (OFF) inhibitors that target inactive GDP-bound KRASG12C cause responses in less than half of patients and these responses are not durable. A class of RASG12C (ON) inhibitors that targets active GTP-bound KRASG12C blocks ERK signaling more potently than the inactive-state inhibitors. Sensitivity to either class of agents is strongly correlated with inhibition of mTORC1 activity. We have previously shown that PI3K/mTOR and ERK-signaling pathways converge on key cellular processes and that inhibition of both pathways is required for inhibition of these processes and for significant antitumor activity. We find here that the combination of a KRASG12C inhibitor with a selective mTORC1 kinase inhibitor causes synergistic inhibition of Cyclin D1 expression and cap-dependent translation. Moreover, BIM upregulation by KRASG12C inhibition and inhibition of MCL-1 expression by the mTORC1 inhibitor are both required to induce significant cell death. In vivo, this combination causes deep, durable tumor regressions and is well tolerated. This study suggests that the ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways each mitigate the effects of inhibition of the other and that combinatorial inhibition is a potential strategy for treating KRASG12C-dependent lung cancer.",

Furthermore, we analyzed the cfDNA methylomes of 215 samples from individuals with liver or brain cancer and individuals without cancer (controls), and trained machine learning models using DMRs, DHMRs or both. The models incorporated with both DMRs and DHMRs show a superior performance compared to models trained with DMRs or DHMRs, with AUROC being 0.978, 0.990, and 0.983 in distinguishing control, liver and brain cancer, respectively, in a validation cohort.

FMD cycles in combination with anti-OX40/anti-PD-L1 also show a trend for increased effects against a lung cancer model. As importantly, the cardiac fibrosis, necrosis and hypertrophy caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors are prevented/reversed by FMD treatment in both cancer models whereas immune infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ cells in myocardial tissues and systemic and myocardial markers of oxidative stress and inflammation are reduced. These results indicate that FMD cycles in combination with immunotherapy can delay cancer growth while reducing side effects including cardiotoxicity.",

It is the most common type of melanoma in individuals with dark skin and is notoriously challenging to treat.

We find that 78.4% of the melanomas display clustered copy number transitions with focal amplifications, recurring predominantly on chromosomes 5, 11, 12, and 22. These complex genomic aberrations are typically shared across all progression stages of individual patients. TERT activating alterations also arise early, whereas MAP-kinase pathway mutations appear later, an inverted order compared to the canonical evolution. The punctuated formation of complex aberrations and early TERT activation suggest a unique mutational mechanism that initiates acral melanoma. The marked intratumoral heterogeneity, especially concerning MAP-kinase pathway mutations, may partly explain the limited success of therapies for this melanoma subtype.",
Targeting of SLC25A22 boosts the immunotherapeutic response in KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer,"Qiming Zhou, Yao Peng, Fenfen Ji, Huarong Chen, Wei Kang, Lam-Shing Chan, Hongyan Gou, Yufeng Lin, Pingmei Huang, Danyu Chen, Qinyao Wei, Hao Su, Cong Liang, Xiang Zhang, Jun Yu, Chi Chun Wong",2023-08-04,"KRAS is an important tumor intrinsic factor driving immune suppression in colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we demonstrate that SLC25A22 underlies mutant KRAS-induced immune suppression in CRC. In immunocompetent male mice and humanized male mice models, SLC25A22 knockout inhibits KRAS-mutant CRC tumor growth with reduced myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) but increased CD8+ T-cells, implying the reversion of mutant KRAS-driven immunosuppression. Mechanistically, we find that SLC25A22 plays a central role in promoting asparagine, which binds and activates SRC phosphorylation. Asparagine-mediated SRC promotes ERK/ETS2 signaling, which drives CXCL1 transcription. Secreted CXCL1 functions as a chemoattractant for MDSC via CXCR2, leading to an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Targeting SLC25A22 or asparagine impairs KRAS-induced MDSC infiltration in CRC. Finally, we demonstrate that the targeting of SLC25A22 in combination with anti-PD1 therapy synergizes to inhibit MDSC and activate CD8+ T cells to suppress KRAS-mutant CRC growth in vivo. We thus identify a metabolic pathway that drives immunosuppression in KRAS-mutant CRC.",

First-line treatment of EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Jietao Ma, Xiaoxue Pang, Shuling Zhang, Letian Huang, Li Sun, Chengbo Han",2024-10-02,"This systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluates first-line treatment options for patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. We analyzed 24 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2,682 patients, comparing various EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and combination therapies. Direct comparisons showed that the addition of bevacizumab or chemotherapy to first-generation (1G) EGFR-TKIs improved overall survival (OS) compared to 1G TKIs alone, with HRs of 0.704 (95% CI: 0.433–0.973) and 0.682 (95% CI: 0.464–0.899), respectively. However, third-generation (3G) TKI monotherapy did not significantly improve OS compared with 1G TKIs, with an HR of 0.855 (95% CI: 0.511–1.198). Indirect comparisons suggested that the combination of 3G TKIs with chemotherapy provided the most significant improvements in OS and progression-free survival (PFS), significantly outperforming 3G TKIs, with HRs of OS 1.69 (95% CI: 1.14–3.4) and PFS 2.13 (95% CI: 1.28–3.54). Intracranial PFS was best with 1G TKIs plus bevacizumab. Our findings suggest that 3G EGFR-TKIs in combination with chemotherapy may be the most effective strategy for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and brain metastases, though further head-to-head trials are needed for validation.","EGFR-TKIs, Non-small cell lung cancer, Brain metastases, First-line therapy, Overall survival"
Monomethyl auristatin antibody and peptide drug conjugates for trimodal cancer chemo-radio-immunotherapy,"Dina V. Hingorani, Michael M. Allevato, Maria F. Camargo, Jacqueline Lesperance, Maryam A.

Silvio Gutkind, Sunil J. Advani",2022-07-05,"Locally advanced cancers remain therapeutically challenging to eradicate. The most successful treatments continue to combine decades old non-targeted chemotherapies with radiotherapy that unfortunately increase normal tissue damage in the irradiated field and have systemic toxicities precluding further treatment intensification. Therefore, alternative molecularly guided systemic therapies are needed to improve patient outcomes when applied with radiotherapy. In this work, we report a trimodal precision cytotoxic chemo-radio-immunotherapy paradigm using spatially targeted auristatin warheads. Tumor-directed antibodies and peptides conjugated to radiosensitizing monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) specifically produce CD8 T cell dependent durable tumor control of irradiated tumors and immunologic memory. In combination with ionizing radiation, MMAE sculpts the tumor immune infiltrate to potentiate immune checkpoint inhibition. Here, we report therapeutic synergies of targeted cytotoxic auristatin radiosensitization to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses providing a rationale for clinical translational of auristatin antibody drug conjugates with radio-immunotherapy combinations to improve tumor control.",
Inhibition of UBA6 by inosine augments tumour immunogenicity and responses,"Lei Zhang, Li Jiang, Liang Yu, Qin Li, Xiangjun Tian, Jingquan He, Ling Zeng, Yuqin Yang, Chaoran Wang, Yuhan Wei, Xiaoyue Jiang, Jing Li, Xiaolu Ge, Qisheng Gu, Jikun Li, Di Wu, Anthony J. Sadler, Di Yu, Dakang Xu, Yue Gao, Xiangliang Yuan, Baokun He",2022-09-15,"Anti-cancer immunity and response to immune therapy is influenced by the metabolic states of the tumours. Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) is known to involve metabolic adaptation, however, the mechanism is not fully known. Here we show, by metabolic profiling of plasma samples from melanoma-bearing mice undergoing anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination therapy, that higher levels of purine metabolites, including inosine, mark ICB sensitivity. Metabolic profiles of ICB-treated human cancers confirm the association between inosine levels and ICB sensitivity. In mouse models, inosine supplementation sensitizes tumours to ICB, even if they are intrinsically ICB resistant, by enhancing T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and hence generating an immunologically hotter microenvironment. We find that inosine directly inhibits UBA6 in tumour cells, and lower level of UBA6 makes the tumour more immunogenic and this is reflected in favourable outcome following ICB therapy in human melanomas. Transplanted mouse melanoma and breast cancer cells with genetic ablation of Uba6 show higher sensitivity to ICB than wild type tumours. Thus, we provide evidence of an inosine-regulated UBA6-dependent pathway governing tumour-intrinsic immunogenicity and hence sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibition, which might provide targets to overcome ICB resistance.",

Speicher",2019-10-11,"Deregulation of transcription factors (TFs) is an important driver of tumorigenesis, but non-invasive assays for assessing transcription factor activity are lacking. Here we develop and validate a minimally invasive method for assessing TF activity based on cell-free DNA sequencing and nucleosome footprint analysis. We analyze whole genome sequencing data for >1,000 cell-free DNA samples from cancer patients and healthy controls using a bioinformatics pipeline developed by us that infers accessibility of TF binding sites from cell-free DNA fragmentation patterns. We observe patient-specific as well as tumor-specific patterns, including accurate prediction of tumor subtypes in prostate cancer, with important clinical implications for the management of patients. Furthermore, we show that cell-free DNA TF profiling is capable of detection of early-stage colorectal carcinomas. Our approach for mapping tumor-specific transcription factor binding in vivo based on blood samples makes a key part of the noncoding genome amenable to clinical analysis.",
"DNA damage response inhibitors in cancer therapy: lessons from the past, current status and future implications","Yvette Drew, Frank T Zenke, Nicola J Curtin",2024-11-12,"The DNA damage response (DDR) is a network of proteins that coordinate DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoints to prevent damage being transmitted to daughter cells. DDR defects lead to genomic instability, which enables tumour development, but they also create vulnerabilities that can be used for cancer therapy. Historically, this vulnerability has been taken advantage of using DNA-damaging cytotoxic drugs and radiotherapy, which are more toxic to tumour cells than to normal tissues. However, the discovery of the unique sensitivity of tumours defective in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway to PARP inhibition led to the approval of six PARP inhibitors worldwide and to a focus on making use of DDR defects through the development of other DDR-targeting drugs. Here, we analyse the lessons learnt from PARP inhibitor development and how these may be applied to new targets to maximize success. We explore why, despite so much research, no other DDR inhibitor class has been approved, and only a handful have advanced to later-stage clinical trials. We discuss why more reliable predictive biomarkers are needed, explore study design from past and current trials, and suggest alternative models for monotherapy and combination studies. Targeting multiple DDR pathways simultaneously and potential combinations with anti-angiogenic agents or immune checkpoint inhibitors are also discussed.",
Molecular imaging supports the development of multispecific cancer antibodies,"Claudia A. J. van Winkel, Frank R. Pierik, Adrienne H. Brouwers, Derk Jan A. de Groot, Elisabeth G. E. de Vries, Marjolijn N. Lub-de Hooge",2024-09-26,"Multispecific antibodies are engineered antibody derivatives that can bind to two or more distinct epitopes or antigens. Unlike mixtures of monospecific antibodies, the binding properties of multispecific antibodies enable two specific molecules to be physically linked, a characteristic with important applications in cancer therapy. The field of multispecific antibodies is highly dynamic and expanding rapidly; to date, 15 multispecific antibodies have been approved for clinical use, of which 11 were approved for oncological indications, and more than 100 new antibodies are currently in clinical development. Nevertheless, substantial challenges limit the applications of multispecific antibodies in cancer therapy, particularly inefficient targeting of solid tumours and substantial adverse effects. Both PET and single photon emission CT imaging can reveal the biodistribution and complex pharmacology of radiolabelled multispecific antibodies. This Review summarizes the insights obtained from preclinical and clinical molecular imaging studies of multispecific antibodies, focusing on their structural properties, such as molecular weight, shape, target specificity, affinity and avidity. The opportunities associated with use of molecular imaging studies to support the clinical development of multispecific antibody therapies are also highlighted.",
Counting growth factors in single cells with infrared quantum dots to measure discrete stimulation distributions,"Phuong Le, Sung Jun Lim, Brian C. Baculis, Hee Jung Chung, Kristopher A. Kilian, Andrew M. Smith",2019-02-22,"The distribution of single-cell properties across a population of cells can be measured using diverse tools, but no technology directly quantifies the biochemical stimulation events regulating these properties. Here we report digital counting of growth factors in single cells using fluorescent quantum dots and calibrated three-dimensional deconvolution microscopy (QDC-3DM) to reveal physiologically relevant cell stimulation distributions. We calibrate the fluorescence intensities of individual compact quantum dots labeled with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and demonstrate the necessity of near-infrared emission to overcome intrinsic cellular autofluoresence at the single-molecule level. When applied to human triple-negative breast cancer cells, we observe proportionality between stimulation and both receptor internalization and inhibitor response, reflecting stimulation heterogeneity contributions to intrinsic variability. We anticipate that QDC-3DM can be applied to analyze any peptidic ligand to reveal single-cell correlations between external stimulation and phenotypic variability, cell fate, and drug response.",
ITGB6 modulates resistance to anti-CD276 therapy in head and neck cancer by promoting PF4+ macrophage infiltration,"Caihua Zhang, Kang Li, Hongzhang Zhu, Maosheng Cheng, Shuang Chen, Rongsong Ling, Cheng Wang, Demeng Chen",2024-08-16,"Enoblituzumab, an immunotherapeutic agent targeting CD276, shows both safety and efficacy in activating T cells and oligodendrocyte-like cells against various cancers. Preclinical studies and mouse models suggest that therapies targeting CD276 may outperform PD1/PD-L1 blockade. However, data from mouse models indicate a significant non-responsive population to anti-CD276 treatment, with the mechanisms of resistance still unclear. In this study, we evaluate the activity of anti-CD276 antibodies in a chemically-induced murine model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Using models of induced and orthotopic carcinogenesis, we identify ITGB6 as a key gene mediating differential responses to anti-CD276 treatment. Through single-cell RNA sequencing and gene-knockout mouse models, we find that ITGB6 regulates the expression of the tumor-associated chemokine CX3CL1, which recruits and activates PF4+ macrophages that express high levels of CX3CR1. Inhibition of the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis suppresses the infiltration and secretion of CXCL16 by PF4+ macrophages, thereby reinvigorating cytotoxic CXCR6+ CD8+ T cells and enhancing sensitivity to anti-CD276 treatment. Further investigations demonstrate that inhibiting ITGB6 restores sensitivity to PD1 antibodies in mice resistant to anti-PD1 treatment. In summary, our research reveals a resistance mechanism associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and identifies potential targets to overcome resistance in cancer treatment.",
Low-dose abiraterone plus Olaparib as a late-line treatment for mCRPC patients without BRCA1/2 mutations: a multicenter retrospective pilot study,"Sijin Chen, Dewen Zhong, Chenbo Yu, Desheng Cai, Qichen Wei, Minggen Yang, Tao Li, Qingguo Zhu, Liefu Ye, Yongbao Wei, Jinfeng Wu",2024-08-27,"Although overall survival data are still premature, the PROpel study found radiological progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of abiraterone and olaparib in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, for patients who have not been genetically tested or lack BRCA1/2 mutations (BRCAm), this combination therapy has been questioned as a first-line conventional treatment for mCRPC, mainly due to significant health economics and side effects. In our retrospective study, we found that treatment with low-dose abiraterone plus olaparib as a late-line treatment for mCRPC could lead to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and symptom PFS in selective cases even without BRCAm. The median PSA–PFS was 8 months (IQR: 6.5–11.5), with a median follow-up duration of 39.0 months (IQR: 27.5–64.5). Gene tests were conducted in all patients, identifying non-BRCA mutations through ctDNA testing (24%), tumor tissue testing (12%), or both (64%). Adverse events occurred in 72% of patients, with 16% experiencing Grade ≥ 3 events. Common adverse events included anemia (64%), decreased appetite (48%), and fatigue (25%). Our findings support low-dose abiraterone plus olaparib as a potential option for mCRPC patients without BRCAm, offering manageable safety and efficacy profiles.","Prostate cancer, Abiraterone, Olaparib, Late-line treatment, mCRPC, BRCA1/2 mutations"
A novel AI-based score for assessing the prognostic value of intra-epithelial lymphocytes in oral epithelial dysplasia,"Adam J. Shephard, Hanya Mahmood, Shan E. Ahmed Raza, Syed Ali Khurram, Nasir M. Rajpoot",2024-11-30,"BackgroundOral epithelial dysplasia (OED) poses a significant clinical challenge due to its potential for malignant transformation and the lack of reliable prognostic markers. Current OED grading systems do not reliably predict transformation and suffer from considerable observer variability. Recent studies have highlighted that peri-epithelial lymphocytes may play an important role in OED malignant transformation, with indication that intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs) may also be important.MethodsWe propose a novel artificial intelligence (AI) based IEL score from Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of OED tissue slides. We determine the prognostic value of our IEL score on a digital dataset of 219 OED WSIs (acquired using three different scanners), compared to pathologist-led clinical grading.ResultsOur IEL scores demonstrated significant prognostic value (C-index = 0.67, p < 0.001) and were shown to improve both the binary/WHO grading systems in multivariate analyses (p < 0.001). Nuclear analyses confirmed the positive association between higher IEL scores, more severe OED and malignant transformation (p < 0.05).ConclusionsThis underscores the potential importance of IELs, and by extension our IEL score, as prognostic indicators in OED. Further validation through prospective multi-centric studies is warranted to confirm the clinical utility of IELs.",

SECOMBIT (NCT02631447) was a randomized, three-arm, noncomparative phase II trial in which patients were randomized to one of two sequences with immunotherapy or targeted therapy first, with a third arm in which an 8-week induction course of targeted therapy followed by a planned switch to immunotherapy was the first treatment. BRAF/MEK inhibitors were encorafenib plus binimetinib and checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab plus nivolumab. Primary outcome of overall survival was previously reported, demonstrating improved survival with immunotherapy administered until progression and followed by BRAF/MEK inhibition. Here we report 4-year survival outcomes, confirming long-term benefit with first-line immunotherapy. We also describe preliminary results of predefined biomarkers analyses that identify a trend toward improved 4-year overall survival and total progression-free survival in patients with loss-of-function mutations affecting JAK or low baseline levels of serum interferon gamma (IFNy). These long-term survival outcomes confirm immunotherapy as the preferred first-line treatment approach for most patients with BRAFV600-mutant metastatic melanoma, and the biomarker analyses are hypothesis-generating for future investigations of predictors of durable benefit with dual checkpoint blockade and targeted therapy.",

This study aimed to analyze the mucosal immune microenvironment in sporadic and metachronous RC. We analyzed the mucosal immune microenvironment in the 25 metachronous RCs present in the IMMUNOREACT 1 and 2 multicentre observational studies (624 patients). A panel of immune markers was retrospectively investigated at immunohistochemistry: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD8b, Tbet, FoxP3, PD-L1, MSH6, and PMS2 and CD80. Single-cell suspensions were subjected to flow-cytometry to determine the proportion of epithelial cells (pan-cytokeratin) acting as antigen-presenting cells (expressing CD80, CD86, HLA-ABC) and the proportion of activated CD8 + T cells (CD8 + positive for CD28, CD38), inhibitory T cells (CD3 + CTLA-4+) of activated CD4 + T helper cells (CD4 + CD25+) and activated T regulatory cells (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3+). No mismatch repair gene deficiencies were observed in the patients. The previous history of colorectal adenoma was significantly more frequent in metachronous RC. In healthy epithelial cells, HLA-ABC expression was significantly higher in patients with metachronous RC. In therapy-naïve metachronous RC patients, a significantly lower level of circulating lymphocytes and CD3 + T-cell infiltration in the healthy mucosa surrounding the RC was observed compared to patients with non-metachronous cancer. Our study supports the hypothesis that metachronous RC can occur in a cancerization field in patients with weak systemic and local immune systems. The peculiar site of RC makes the mismatch-repair genes deficiency in metachronous cancer onset less relevant.",

We evaluated TB along with other histological parameters (morphology, tumor-stroma-ratio, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion) and calculated survival outcomes using both univariate and multivariate analyses.ResultsTB was identified as an independent prognostic parameter, with TB-high cases showing inferior outcomes in univariate (HR: 3.08, 95%-CI: 1.71–5.54) and multivariate analyses (HR: 4.03, 95%-CI: 1.65–9.83). Similarly, LVI remained an independent prognostic factor (HR: 3.00, 95%-CI: 1.22–7.38). A combined classification including TB and LVI stratified cases into low-, intermediate- and high-risk categories. We could not detect correlations between TB and the number of lymph node metastases or between TB and an extracapsular extension of lymph node metastases.ConclusionsIn addition to LVI, we could identify TB as an independent prognostic factor in p16-positive OPSCC in this multicenter study cohort. Thus, evaluating TB along with LVI in a combined scheme for prognostication might help to establish a more personalized treatment regimen for patients with p16-positive OPSCC.",

Harrington",2024-08-13,"The combination of radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade can result in poor outcomes in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here, we show that combining ATR inhibition (ATRi) with radiotherapy (RT) increases the frequency of activated NKG2A+PD-1+ T cells in animal models of HNSCC. Compared with the ATRi/RT treatment regimen alone, the addition of simultaneous NKG2A and PD-L1 blockade to ATRi/RT, in the adjuvant, post-radiotherapy setting induces a robust antitumour response driven by higher infiltration and activation of cytotoxic T cells in the tumour microenvironment. The efficacy of this combination relies on CD40/CD40L costimulation and infiltration of activated, proliferating memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with persistent or new T cell receptor (TCR) signalling, respectively. We also observe increased richness in the TCR repertoire and emergence of numerous and large TCR clonotypes that cluster based on antigen specificity in response to NKG2A/PD-L1/ATRi/RT. Collectively, our data point towards potential combination approaches for the treatment of HNSCC.",
5-Fluorouracil combined with CalliSphere drug-eluting beads or conventional transarterial chemoembolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a propensity score weighting analysis,"Min Wei, Pengwei Zhang, Chaofeng Yang, Menglin Luo, Chengxi Zeng, Yujie Zhang, Yang Li",2024-10-26,"This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu) combined with conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) compared to 5-Fu combined with drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) using CalliSpheres for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using propensity score weighting methods. This retrospective analysis included 131 patients with HCC treated with 5-Fu combined with cTACE (5-Fu-cTACE group, n = 65) or DEB-TACE (5-Fu-DEB-TACE group, n = 66) at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College from January 2019 to December 2022. Based on the baseline data and laboratory indicators, propensity score weighting was used to reduce confounding bias. Modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST) were used to evaluate clinical efficacy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were the disease control rate (DCR), objective response rate (ORR) and adverse events (AEs). PFS was assessed using Kaplan‒Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. The ORRs at 1 month (M1) after treatment in the 5-Fu-DEB-TACE group and 5-Fu-cTACE group were 90.9% and 76.9%, respectively (P = 0.029), while at this time, the DCRs were 93.9% in the 5-Fu-DEB-TACE group and 90.8% in the 5-Fu-cTACE group (P = 0.494). At 3 months (M3) after treatment, the 5-Fu-DEB-TACE group had a higher ORR (84.8% vs. 56.9%, P < 0.001) and DCR (84.8% vs. 72.3%, P = 0.08). The ORR at 6 months (M6) was also higher in the 5-Fu-DEB-TACE group than in the 5-Fu-cTACE group (72.7% vs. 50.8%, P = 0.01). The median PFS after treatment with 5-Fu-DEB-TACE was longer than that after treatment with 5-Fu-cTACE (11 months vs. 6 months) (P = 0.004). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that 5-Fu-DEB-TACE (HR = 0.590, P = 0.044), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) intermediate risk (HR = 2.470, P = 0.010), BCLC stage B (HR = 2.303, P = 0.036), BCLC stage C (HR = 3.354, P = 0.002) and ascitic fluid (HR = 2.004, P = 0.046) were independent predictors of PFS. No treatment-related deaths occurred in this study. The 5-Fu-DEB-TACE group had a greater incidence of abdominal pain (72.7% vs. 47.7%, P = 0.003). However, the incidence of postoperative elevated transaminase levels was higher in the 5-Fu-cTACE group (83.1% vs. 66.6%, P = 0.031). Subgroups analysis showed patients receiving 5-Fu-DEB-TACE have better PFS compared to those receiving 5-Fu-cTACE in the BCLC stage A group (P = 0.0093), BCLC stage B group (P = 0.0096), multifocal group (P = 0.0056), Child-Pugh stage A group (P<0.001), non- extrahepatic metastasis group (P = 0.022), non-vascular invasion group (P = 0.0093), and the group with a largest tumor diameter ≥ 5 cm (P = 0.0048). At M1, M3, and M6, patients with preserved liver function and in some cases of low tumor burden had higher Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Disease Control Rate (DCR) (P < 0.05). Compared with 5-Fu-cTACE, 5-Fu-DEB-TACE has superior therapeutic efficacy, prolongs PFS, and reduces hepatotoxicity. However, it is associated with an increased incidence of postoperative abdominal pain.","Hepatocellular carcinoma, TACE, Drug-eluting beads, Propensity score analysis, Efficacy and safety"

In this study, we aimed to identify potential PDK3 inhibitors using a computer-based drug design approach. Virtual screening of the FDA-approved library of 3839 compounds was carried out, from which Bagrosin and Dehydrocholic acid appeared best due to their strong binding affinity, specific interactions, and potential biological characteristics, and thus were selected for further investigations. Both compounds show strong interactions with functionally important residues of the PDK3 with a binding affinity of − 10.6 and − 10.5 kcal/mol for Bagrosin and Dehydrocholic acid, respectively. MD simulation studies for 100 ns suggest the formation of stable complexes, which is evident from RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and SASA parameters. The PCA and FEL analysis suggested admirable global energy minima for the bagrosin-PDK3 and dehydrocholic acid-PDK3 complexes.

The majority of PCL cases (87.2%) were of T-/NK-cell lineage (CTCL), while the remaining cases (12.8%) were B-cell lineage lymphomas (CBCL). The prevalence of mycosis fungoides (MF) in CTCL increased significantly over time, while other CTCL subtypes, including primary cutaneous extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL), decreased in frequency. Notably, the prevalence of CD4-positive small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder showed a substantial increase over time. Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma was consistently the commonest CBCL subtype. Survival analysis demonstrated that CTCL had a more favorable 5-year overall survival (OS) than CBCL. OS rate of MF, SPTCL, and primary cutaneous peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS improved significantly over time. This study provides comprehensive insights into the dynamic change in the relative frequency and overall survival of PCL subtypes over time.","Primary cutaneous lymphoma, T-/NK-cell lineage, B-cell lineage lymphomas, Mycosis fungoides, Incidence, Survival analysis"

Twenty-six patients are treated in four cohorts assessing increasing doses of IFN-γ with nivolumab to evaluate the primary endpoint of safety and determine the recommended phase two dose (RP2D). Most common adverse events are low grade and associated with IFN-γ. Three dose limiting toxicities are reported at the highest dose cohorts. We report only one patient with any immune related adverse event (irAE). No irAEs ≥ grade 3 are observed and no patients require corticosteroids. The maximum tolerated dose of IFN-γ is 75 mcg/m2, however based on a composite of safety, clinical, and correlative factors the RP2D is 50 mcg/m2. Exploratory analyses of efficacy in the phase I cohorts demonstrate one patient with a complete response, and five have achieved stable disease. Pre-planned correlative assessments of circulating immune cells demonstrate intermediate monocytes with increased PD-L1 expression correlating with IFN-γ dose and treatment duration. Interestingly, post-hoc analysis shows that IFN-γ induction increases circulating chemokines and is associated with an observed paucity of irAEs, warranting further evaluation.

Here we present a hydrogel microsphere vaccine that amplifies post-ablation anti-cancer immune response via releasing its cargo of FLT3L and CD40L at the relatively lower pH of the tumour bed. The vaccine facilitates migration of the tumour-resident type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) to the tumour-draining lymph nodes (TdLN), thus initiating the cDC1-mediated antigen cross-presentation cascade, resulting in enhanced endogenous CD8+ T cell response. We show in an orthotopic pancreatic cancer model in male mice that the hydrogel microsphere vaccine transforms the immunologically cold tumour microenvironment into hot in a safe and efficient manner, thus significantly increasing survival and inhibiting the growth of distant metastases.",
The transcriptional landscape and diagnostic potential of long non-coding RNAs in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Meng Zhou, Siqi Bao, Tongyang Gong, Qiang Wang, Jie Sun, Jiaqi Li, Minyi Lu, Wanyuan Sun, Jianzhong Su, Hongyan Chen, Zhihua Liu",2023-06-26,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a deadly cancer with no clinically relevant biomarkers for early detection. Here, we comprehensively characterized the transcriptional landscape of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in paired tumor and normal tissue specimens from 93 ESCC patients, and identified six key malignancy-specific lncRNAs that were integrated into a Multi-LncRNA Malignancy Risk Probability model (MLMRPscore). The MLMRPscore performed robustly in distinguishing ESCC from normal controls in multiple in-house and external multicenter validation cohorts, including early-stage I/II cancer. In addition, five candidate lncRNAs were confirmed to have non-invasive diagnostic potential in our institute plasma cohort, showing superior or comparable diagnostic accuracy to current clinical serological markers. Overall, this study highlights the profound and robust dysregulation of lncRNAs in ESCC and demonstrates the potential of lncRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers for the early detection of ESCC.",
Impact of TMB/PD-L1 expression and pneumonitis on chemoradiation and durvalumab response in stage III NSCLC,"Joao V.

Here, in a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of 328 patients treated with CRT and durvalumab, we identify that very high PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS) expression ( ≥ 90%) and increased tumor mutational burden (TMB) are independently associated with prolonged disease control. Additionally, we identify the impact of pneumonitis and its timing on disease outcomes among patients who discontinue durvalumab: compared to patients who experienced early-onset pneumonitis ( < 3 months) leading to durvalumab discontinuation, patients with late-onset pneumonitis had a significantly longer PFS (12.7 months vs not reached; HR 0.24 [95% CI, 0.10 to 0.58]; P = 0.001) and overall survival (37.2 months vs not reached; HR 0.26 [95% CI, 0.09 to 0.79]; P = 0.017). These findings suggest that opportunities exist to improve outcomes in patients with lower PD-L1 and TMB levels, and those at highest risk for pneumonitis.",

Here we report a Phase I dose escalation trial (NCT02546921) with the primary objective of exploring the safety and tolerability of MOv18 IgE, a chimeric first-in-class IgE antibody, in patients with tumours expressing the relevant antigen, folate receptor-alpha. The trial incorporated skin prick and basophil activation tests (BAT) to select patients at lowest risk of allergic toxicity. Secondary objectives were exploration of anti-tumour activity, recommended Phase II dose, and pharmacokinetics. Dose escalation ranged from 70 μg–12 mg. The most common toxicity of MOv18 IgE is transient urticaria. A single patient experienced anaphylaxis, likely explained by detection of circulating basophils at baseline that could be activated by MOv18 IgE. The BAT assay was used to avoid enrolling further patients with reactive basophils. The safety profile is tolerable and maximum tolerated dose has not been reached, with evidence of anti-tumour activity observed in a patient with ovarian cancer. These results demonstrate the potential of IgE therapy for cancer.",
The blood proteome of imminent lung cancer diagnosis,The Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium (LC3),2023-06-01,"Identification of risk biomarkers may enhance early detection of smoking-related lung cancer. We measured between 392 and 1,162 proteins in blood samples drawn at most three years before diagnosis in 731 smoking-matched case-control sets nested within six prospective cohorts from the US, Europe, Singapore, and Australia. We identify 36 proteins with independently reproducible associations with risk of imminent lung cancer diagnosis (all p < 4 × 10−5). These include a few markers (e.g. CA-125/MUC-16 and CEACAM5/CEA) that have previously been reported in studies using pre-diagnostic blood samples for lung cancer. The 36 proteins include several growth factors (e.g. HGF, IGFBP-1, IGFP-2), tumor necrosis factor-receptors (e.g. TNFRSF6B, TNFRSF13B), and chemokines and cytokines (e.g. CXL17, GDF-15, SCF). The odds ratio per standard deviation range from 1.31 for IGFBP-1 (95% CI: 1.17–1.47) to 2.43 for CEACAM5 (95% CI: 2.04–2.89). We map the 36 proteins to the hallmarks of cancer and find that activation of invasion and metastasis, proliferative signaling, tumor-promoting inflammation, and angiogenesis are most frequently implicated.",
TSG-6+ cancer-associated fibroblasts modulate myeloid cell responses and impair anti-tumor response to immune checkpoint therapy in pancreatic cancer,"Swetha Anandhan, Shelley Herbrich, Sangeeta Goswami, Baoxiang Guan, Yulong Chen, Marc Daniel Macaluso, Sonali Jindal, Seanu Meena Natarajan, Samuel W. Andrewes, Liangwen Xiong, Ashwat Nagarajan, Sreyashi Basu, Derek Ng Tang, Jielin Liu, Jimin Min, Anirban Maitra, Padmanee Sharma",2024-07-10,"Resistance to immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) presents a growing clinical challenge. The tumor microenvironment (TME) and its components, namely tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), play a pivotal role in ICT resistance; however, the underlying mechanisms remain under investigation. In this study, we identify expression of TNF-Stimulated Factor 6 (TSG-6) in ICT-resistant pancreatic tumors, compared to ICT-sensitive melanoma tumors, both in mouse and human. TSG-6 is expressed by CAFs within the TME, where suppressive macrophages expressing Arg1, Mafb, and Mrc1, along with TSG-6 ligand Cd44, predominate. Furthermore, TSG-6 expressing CAFs co-localize with the CD44 expressing macrophages in the TME. TSG-6 inhibition in combination with ICT improves therapy response and survival in pancreatic tumor-bearing mice by reducing macrophages expressing immunosuppressive phenotypes and increasing CD8 T cells. Overall, our findings propose TSG-6 as a therapeutic target to enhance ICT response in non-responsive tumors.",

Patients with mCRC enrolled in the GOZILA study initially diagnosed with tissue RAS MT mCRC and received subsequent systemic therapy are eligible. NeoRAS WT is defined as the absence of detectable RAS MT in plasma and assessed in all eligible patients (Group A) and in a subgroup with at least one somatic alteration detected in plasma (Group B). Overall, 478 patients are included. NeoRAS WT prevalence is 19.0% (91/478) in Group A and 9.8% (42/429) in Group B. Absence of liver or lymph node metastasis and tissue RAS MTs other than KRAS exon 2 MTs are significantly associated with NeoRAS WT emergence. Overall, 1/6 and 2/6 patients with NeoRAS WT treated with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) show partial response and stable disease for ≥6 months, respectively. NeoRAS WT mCRC is observed at a meaningful prevalence, and anti-EGFR mAb-based therapy may be effective.",
Combining amino acid PET and MRI imaging increases accuracy to define malignant areas in adult glioma,"Maciej Harat, Józefina Rakowska, Marek Harat, Tadeusz Szylberg, Jacek Furtak, Izabela Miechowicz, Bogdan Małkowski",2023-07-29,"Accurate determination of the extent and grade of adult-type diffuse gliomas is critical to patient management. In clinical practice, contrast-enhancing areas of diffuse gliomas in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences are usually used to target biopsy, surgery, and radiation therapy, but there can be discrepancies between these areas and the actual tumor extent. Here we show that adding 18F-fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography (FET-PET) to MRI sequences accurately locates the most malignant areas of contrast-enhancing gliomas, potentially impacting subsequent management and outcomes. We present a prospective analysis of over 300 serial biopsy specimens from 23 patients with contrast-enhancing adult-type diffuse gliomas using a hybrid PET-MRI scanner to compare T2-weighted and contrast-enhancing MRI images with FET-PET. In all cases, we observe and confirm high FET uptake in early PET acquisitions (5–15 min after 18F-FET administration) outside areas of contrast enhancement on MRI, indicative of high-grade glioma. In 30% cases, inclusion of FET-positive sites changes the biopsy result to a higher tumor grade.",

Here we investigate KRAS ctDNA (ctKRAS) variant-specific associations with overall and progression-free survival (OS/PFS) in first-line metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) for patients receiving chemoimmunotherapy (“PRINCE”, NCT03214250), and an independent cohort receiving standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. For PRINCE, higher baseline plasma levels are associated with worse OS for ctKRAS G12D (log-rank p = 0.0010) but not G12V (p = 0.7101), even with adjustment for clinical covariates. Early, on-therapy clearance of G12D (p = 0.0002), but not G12V (p = 0.4058), strongly associates with OS for PRINCE. Similar results are obtained for the SOC cohort, and for PFS in both cohorts. These results suggest ctKRAS G12D but not G12V as a promising prognostic biomarker for mPDAC and that G12D clearance could also serve as an early biomarker of response.",
NOTCH4ΔL12_16 sensitizes lung adenocarcinomas to EGFR-TKIs through transcriptional down-regulation of HES1,"Bin Zhang, Shaowei Dong, Jian Wang, Tuxiong Huang, Pan Zhao, Jing Xu, Dongcheng Liu, Li Fu, Lingwei Wang, Guangsuo Wang, Chang Zou",2023-06-02,"Resistance to epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) remains one of the major challenges in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) therapy. Here, we find an increased frequency of the L12_16 amino acid deletion mutation in the signal peptide region of NOTCH4 (NOTCH4ΔL12_16) in EGFR-TKI-sensitive patients. Functionally, exogenous induction of NOTCH4ΔL12_16 in EGFR-TKI -resistant LUAD cells sensitizes them to EGFR-TKIs. This process is mainly mediated by the reduction of the intracellular domain of NOTCH4 (NICD4) caused by the NOTCH4ΔL12_16 mutation, which results in a lower localization of NOTCH4 in the plasma membrane. Mechanistically, NICD4 transcriptionally upregulates the expression of HES1 by competitively binding to the gene promoter relative to p-STAT3. Because p-STAT3 can downregulate the expression of HES1 in EGFR-TKI-resistant LUAD cells, the reduction of NICD4 induced by NOTCH4ΔL12_16 mutation leads to a decrease in HES1. Moreover, inhibition of the NOTCH4-HES1 pathway using inhibitors and siRNAs abolishes the resistance of EGFR-TKI. Overall, we report that the NOTCH4ΔL12_16 mutation sensitizes LUAD patients to EGFR-TKIs through transcriptional down-regulation of HES1 and that targeted blockade of this signaling cohort could reverse EGFR-TKI -resistance in LUAD, providing a potential approach to overcome resistance to EGFR-TKI -therapy.",
Oncogenic structural aberration landscape in gastric cancer genomes,"Mihoko Saito-Adachi, Natsuko Hama, Yasushi Totoki, Hiromi Nakamura, Yasuhito Arai, Fumie Hosoda, Hirofumi Rokutan, Shinichi Yachida, Mamoru Kato, Akihiko Fukagawa, Tatsuhiro Shibata",2023-06-22,"Structural variants (SVs) are responsible for driver events in gastric cancer (GC); however, their patterns and processes remain poorly understood. Here, we examine 170 GC whole genomes to unravel the oncogenic structural aberration landscape in GC genomes and identify six rearrangement signatures (RSs). Non-random combinations of RSs elucidate distinctive GC subtypes comprising one or a few dominant RS that are associated with specific driver events (BRCA1/2 defects, mismatch repair deficiency, and TP53 mutation) and epidemiological backgrounds. Twenty-seven SV hotspots are identified as GC driver candidates. SV hotspots frequently constitute complexly clustered SVs involved in driver gene amplification, such as ERBB2, CCNE1, and FGFR2. Further deconstruction of the locally clustered SVs uncovers amplicon-generating profiles characterized by super-large SVs and intensive segmental amplifications, contributing to the extensive amplification of GC oncogenes. Comprehensive analyses using adjusted SV allele frequencies indicate the significant involvement of extra-chromosomal DNA in processes linked to specific RSs.",

Galli",2023-07-03,"YAP is a key transcriptional co-activator of TEADs, it regulates cell growth and is frequently activated in cancer. In Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM), YAP is activated by loss-of-function mutations in upstream components of the Hippo pathway, while, in Uveal Melanoma (UM), YAP is activated in a Hippo-independent manner. To date, it is unclear if and how the different oncogenic lesions activating YAP impact its oncogenic program, which is particularly relevant for designing selective anti-cancer therapies. Here we show that, despite YAP being essential in both MPM and UM, its interaction with TEAD is unexpectedly dispensable in UM, limiting the applicability of TEAD inhibitors in this cancer type. Systematic functional interrogation of YAP regulatory elements in both cancer types reveals convergent regulation of broad oncogenic drivers in both MPM and UM, but also strikingly selective programs. Our work reveals unanticipated lineage-specific features of the YAP regulatory network that provide important insights to guide the design of tailored therapeutic strategies to inhibit YAP signaling across different cancer types.",
Effects of diets on risks of cancer and the mediating role of metabolites,"Yi Fan, Chanchan Hu, Xiaoxu Xie, Yanfeng Weng, Chen Chen, Zhaokun Wang, Xueqiong He, Dongxia Jiang, Shaodan Huang, Zhijian Hu, Fengqiong Liu",2024-07-13,"Research on the association between dietary adherence and cancer risk is limited, particularly concerning overall cancer risk and its underlying mechanisms. Using the UK Biobank data, we prospectively investigate the associations between adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) or a Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet (MINDDiet) and the risk of overall and 22 specific cancers, as well as the mediating effects of metabolites. Here we show significant negative associations of MedDiet and MINDDiet adherence with overall cancer risk. These associations remain robust across 14 and 13 specific cancers, respectively. Then, a sequential analysis, incorporating Cox regression, elastic net and gradient boost models, identify 10 metabolites associated with overall cancer risk. Mediation results indicate that these metabolites play a crucial role in the association between adherence to a MedDiet or a MINDDiet and cancer risk, independently and cumulatively.

Here, we reveal that co-enhancement of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) enzymes (CPT1A, CPT2 and ACAD9) and immune checkpoint CD47 is dominant in recurrent GBM patients with poor prognosis. A glycolysis-to-FAO metabolic rewiring is associated with CD47 anti-phagocytosis in radioresistant GBM cells and regrown GBM after radiation in syngeneic mice. Inhibition of FAO by CPT1 inhibitor etomoxir or CRISPR-generated CPT1A−/−, CPT2−/−, ACAD9−/− cells demonstrate that FAO-derived acetyl-CoA upregulates CD47 transcription via NF-κB/RelA acetylation. Blocking FAO impairs tumor growth and reduces CD47 anti-phagocytosis. Etomoxir combined with anti-CD47 antibody synergizes radiation control of regrown tumors with boosted macrophage phagocytosis. These results demonstrate that enhanced fat acid metabolism promotes aggressive growth of GBM with CD47-mediated immune evasion. The FAO-CD47 axis may be targeted to improve GBM control by eliminating the radioresistant phagocytosis-proofing tumor cells in GBM radioimmunotherapy.",
Reconstructing oral cavity tumor evolution through brush biopsy,"Evit John, Tom Lesluyes, Toby M. Baker, Maxime Tarabichi, Ann Gillenwater, Jennifer R. Wang, Peter Van Loo, Xiao Zhao",2024-09-30,"Oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) with genomic alterations have a heightened risk of evolving into oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Currently, genomic data are typically obtained through invasive tissue biopsy. However, brush biopsy is a non-invasive method that has been utilized for identifying dysplastic cells in OPMD but its effectiveness in reflecting the genomic landscape of OPMDs remains uncertain. This pilot study investigates the potential of brush biopsy samples in accurately reconstructing the genomic profile and tumor evolution in a patient with both OPMD and OSCC. We analyzed single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number aberrations (CNAs), and subclonal architectures in paired tissue and brush biopsy samples. The results showed that brush biopsy effectively captured 90% of SNVs and had similar CNA profiles as those seen in its paired tissue biopsies in all lesions. It was specific, as normal buccal mucosa did not share these genomic alterations. Interestingly, brush biopsy revealed shared SNVs and CNAs between the distinct OPMD and OSCC lesions from the same patient, indicating a common ancestral origin. Subclonal reconstruction confirmed this shared ancestry, followed by divergent evolution of the lesions. These findings highlight the potential of brush biopsies in accurately representing the genomic profile of OPL and OSCC, proving insight into reconstructing tumor evolution.",
Low densities of immune cells indicate unfavourable overall survival in patients suffering from squamous cell carcinoma of the lung,"Simone Steffens, Claudia Kayser, Anuschka Roesner, Justyna Rawluk, Severin Schmid, Eleni Gkika, Gian Kayser",2024-06-20,"Carcinogenesis and tumor proliferation are characterized by a complex interaction of cancer cells with the tumor microenvironment. In particular, a tumor-promoting effect can be assumed for the stroma and its fibroblasts. An influence of the immune system on non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is now also suspected. In our study, we examined 309 sections of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a subtype of NSCLC. We determined the cell densities and areas of the different tissues in SCC using the software QuPath. Spearman rank correlation showed a significant positive correlation between the different tumor cell densities and stromal cell densities, and between tumor cell densities and immune cell densities. Overall survival curves by the Kaplan–Meier method revealed a prominent negative curve in cases of low immune cell density. Based on our results, we can assume a positive influence of the tumor microenvironment, especially the stromal cells, on tumor proliferation in SCC. We have also revealed that low density of immune cells is prognostically unfavorable.",

Bmi-1, a member of the Polycomb group family of transcriptional repressors, is expressed in a variety of tumors. The purpose of our study was to explore the role of Bmi-1 in retinoblastoma. RT-qPCR and western blot were used for calculating the mRNA and protein levels of Bmi-1 and RKIP. MTT, Wound healing and Transwell assays were performed to measure the proliferation, migration and invasion in retinoblastoma cells. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The volume and mass of transplanted tumors were detected in nude mice. Bmi-1 was over expressed, and RKIP was low expressed in retinoblastoma cells. Bmi-1 promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion and suppressed cell apoptosis of Y79 and SO-RB50 cells. Downregulation of Bmi-1 and overexpression of RKIP inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased cell apoptosis. The functions of Bmi-1 knockdown on retinoblastoma cells were blocked by RKIP knockdown, but promoted by RKIP. Down-regulated Bmi-1 inhibited xenograft tumor growth, and RKIP exacerbated this inhibitory effect. Bmi-1 served as a potential therapeutic target for improving the efficacy of clinical treatment in retinoblastoma. All the findings revealed the functions of Bmi-1/RKIP axis in retinoblastoma tumorigenesis.","Bmi-1, RKIP, Retinoblastoma, Tumorigenesis"

Here we used them to investigate relapse after treatment. Patient-derived organoids expand from highly proliferative LGR5+ tumor cells; however, we discovered that lack of optimal growth conditions specifies a latent LGR5+ cell state. This cell population expressed the gene MEX3A, is chemoresistant and regenerated the organoid culture after treatment. In CRC mouse models, Mex3a+ cells contributed marginally to metastatic outgrowth; however, after chemotherapy, Mex3a+ cells produced large cell clones that regenerated the disease. Lineage-tracing analysis showed that persister Mex3a+ cells downregulate the WNT/stem cell gene program immediately after chemotherapy and adopt a transient state reminiscent to that of YAP+ fetal intestinal progenitors. In contrast, Mex3a-deficient cells differentiated toward a goblet cell-like phenotype and were unable to resist chemotherapy. Our findings reveal that adaptation of cancer stem cells to suboptimal niche environments protects them from chemotherapy and identify a candidate cell of origin of relapse after treatment in CRC.",

Identifying affected axillary lymph nodes before neoadjuvant treatment is crucial, as such treatment may alter drainage pathways and lymph node morphology, hindering the identification of sentinel lymph nodes. The use of carbon-based tattooing on sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) has been employed as a permanent tattooing method in clinical studies of Targeted Axillary Dissection (TAD), aiding in the SLN identification during surgery. Our study introduces a new method of lymph node tattooing based on poly lactic-co-glycolic (PLGA) particles with encapsulated carbon. This strategy substantially improves tattooing efficiency over single carbon suspensions currently used in clinical studies. We synthesized and characterized carbon-loaded PLGA micro- and nanoparticles, experimentally assessing their biological impact on porcine lymph nodes. The effect of particles’ size and concentration was evaluated over time (from 1 to 16 weeks). Light and electron microscopy studies were conducted to characterize the cellular effects induced by the presence of these particles. Our findings reveal that the diverse physicochemical parameters of the particles interact differently with the lymphatic tissue, influencing their biodistribution within the lymph nodes and the intensity of the inflammatory response.","Targeted-axillary dissection, Sentinel lymph node biopsy, Nanoparticles, Carbon, Ultrastructure, Breast cancer, Carbon-tattooing"

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute the prominant population of immune cells in tumor tissues, contributing to the formation of CSC niches and a suppressive immune microenvironment. Here, we report that high expression of inhibitor of differentiation 1 (ID1) in TAMs correlates with poor outcome in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). ID1 expressing macrophages maintain cancer stemness and impede CD8+ T cell infiltration. Mechanistically, ID1 interacts with STAT1 to induce its cytoplasmic distribution and inhibits STAT1-mediated SerpinB2 and CCL4 transcription, two secretory factors responsible for cancer stemness inhibition and CD8+ T cell recruitment. Reducing ID1 expression ameliorates CRC progression and enhances tumor sensitivity to immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Collectively, our study highlights the pivotal role of ID1 in controlling the protumor phenotype of TAMs and paves the way for therapeutic targeting of ID1 in CRC.",
Modelling post-chemotherapy stem cell dynamics in the bone marrow niche of AML patients,"Chenxu Zhu, Thomas Stiehl",2024-10-23,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a stem cell-driven malignancy of the blood forming (hematopoietic) system. Despite of high dose chemotherapy with toxic side effects, many patients eventually relapse. The “7+3 regimen”, which consists of 7 days of cytarabine in combination with daunorubicin during the first 3 days, is a widely used therapy protocol. Since peripheral blood cells are easily accessible to longitudinal sampling, significant research efforts have been undertaken to characterize and reduce adverse effects on circulating blood cells. However, much less is known about the impact of the 7+3 regimen on human hematopoietic stem cells and their physiological micro-environments, the so-called stem cell niches. One reason for this is the technical inability to observe human stem cells in vivo and the discomfort related to bone marrow biopsies. To better understand the treatment effects on human stem cells, we consider a mechanistic mathematical model of the stem cell niche before, during and after chemotherapy. The model accounts for different maturation stages of leukemic and hematopoietic cells and considers key processes such as cell proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation and therapy-induced cell death. In the model, hematopoietic (HSCs) and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) compete for a joint niche and respond to both systemic and niche-derived signals. We relate the model to clinical trial data from literature which longitudinally quantifies the counts of hematopoietic stem like (CD34+CD38-ALDH+) cells at diagnosis and after therapy. The proposed model can capture the clinically observed interindividual heterogeneity and reproduce the non-monotonous dynamics of the hematopoietic stem like cells observed in relapsing patients. Our model allows to simulate different scenarios proposed in literature such as therapy-related impairment of the stem cell niche or niche-mediated resistance. Model simulations suggest that during the post-therapy phase a more than 10-fold increase of hematopoietic stem-like cell proliferation rates is required to recapitulate the measured cell dynamics in patients achieving complete remission. We fit the model to data of 7 individual patients and simulate variations of the treatment protocol. These simulations are in line with the clinical finding that G-CSF priming can improve the treatment outcome. Furthermore, our model suggests that a decline of HSC counts during remission might serve as an indication for salvage therapy in patients lacking MRD (minimal residual disease) markers.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 7+3 chemotherapy, Stem cell niche, Cancer stem cell, Computational model, Mathematical model"
Development of an efficient NUPR1 inhibitor with anticancer activity,"Xi Liu, Ana Jimenez-Alesanco, Zexian Li, Bruno Rizzuti, José L. Neira, Matías Estaras, Ling Peng, Eduardo Chuluyan, Juan Garona, Florencia Gottardo, Adrián Velazquez-Campoy, Yi Xia, Olga Abian, Patricia Santofimia-Castaño, Juan Iovanna",2024-11-27,"Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal and has limited treatment options available. Our team had previously developed ZZW-115, a promising drug candidate that targets the nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1), which is involved in pancreatic cancer development and progression. However, clinical translation of ZZW-115 was hindered due to potential cardiotoxicity caused by its interaction with the human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel. To address this, we have performed a high-throughput screening of 10,000 compounds from the HitFinder Chemical Library, and identified AJO14 as a lead compound that binds to NUPR1, without having favorable affinity towards hERG. AJO14 induced cell death through apoptosis, necroptosis, and parthanatos (induced by the poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) overactivation), driven by mitochondrial catastrophe and decreased ATP production. This process seemed to be mediated by the hyperPARylation (an excessive modification of proteins by PARP, leading to cellular dysfunction), as it could be reversed by Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor. In xenografted mice, AJO14 demonstrated a dose-dependent tumor reduction activity. Furthermore, we attempted to improve the anti-cancer properties of AJO14 by molecular modification of the lead compound. Among the 51 candidates obtained and tested, 8 compounds exhibited a significant increase in efficacy and have been retained for further studies, especially LZX-2-73. These AJO14-derived compounds offer potent NUPR1 inhibition for pancreatic cancer treatment, without cardiotoxicity concerns.",
Tumour-intrinsic endomembrane trafficking by ARF6 shapes an immunosuppressive microenvironment that drives melanomagenesis and response to checkpoint blockade therapy,"Yinshen Wee, Junhua Wang, Emily C.

Oviedo, Keke C. Fairfax, Matthew A. Williams, Sheri L. Holmen, Roger K. Wolff, Allie H. Grossmann",2024-08-04,"Tumour-host immune interactions lead to complex changes in the tumour microenvironment (TME), impacting progression, metastasis and response to therapy. While it is clear that cancer cells can have the capacity to alter immune landscapes, our understanding of this process is incomplete. Herein we show that endocytic trafficking at the plasma membrane, mediated by the small GTPase ARF6, enables melanoma cells to impose an immunosuppressive TME that accelerates tumour development. This ARF6-dependent TME is vulnerable to immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICB) but in murine melanoma, loss of Arf6 causes resistance to ICB. Likewise, downregulation of ARF6 in patient tumours correlates with inferior overall survival after ICB. Mechanistically, these phenotypes are at least partially explained by ARF6-dependent recycling, which controls plasma membrane density of the interferon-gamma receptor. Collectively, our findings reveal the importance of endomembrane trafficking in outfitting tumour cells with the ability to shape their immune microenvironment and respond to immunotherapy.",
A region-confined PROTAC nanoplatform for spatiotemporally tunable protein degradation and enhanced cancer therapy,"Jing Gao, Xingyu Jiang, Shumin Lei, Wenhao Cheng, Yi Lai, Min Li, Lei Yang, Peifeng Liu, Xiao-hua Chen, Min Huang, Haijun Yu, Huixiong Xu, Zhiai Xu",2024-08-04,"The antitumor performance of PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) is limited by its insufficient tumor specificity and poor pharmacokinetics. These disadvantages are further compounded by tumor heterogeneity, especially the presence of cancer stem-like cells, which drive tumor growth and relapse. Herein, we design a region-confined PROTAC nanoplatform that integrates both reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activatable and hypoxia-responsive PROTAC prodrugs for the precise manipulation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 expression and tumor eradication. These PROTAC nanoparticles selectively accumulate within and penetrate deep into tumors via response to matrix metalloproteinase-2. Photoactivity is then reactivated in response to the acidic intracellular milieu and the PROTAC is discharged due to the ROS generated via photodynamic therapy specifically within the normoxic microenvironment. Moreover, the latent hypoxia-responsive PROTAC prodrug is restored in hypoxic cancer stem-like cells overexpressing nitroreductase. Here, we show the ability of region-confined PROTAC nanoplatform to effectively degrade BRD4 in both normoxic and hypoxic environments, markedly hindering tumor progression in breast and head-neck tumor models.",
Ubiquitin-related gene markers predict immunotherapy response and prognosis in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma,"Donglin Luo, Xiaoning Li, Li Wei, Yankun Yu, Yeernaer Hazaisihan, Lin Tao, Siyuan Li, Wei Jia",2024-10-24,"Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is the most fatal among female reproductive system tumors. The immune tumor microenvironment and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are closely related to the proliferation, invasion, and response to chemotherapy in EOC. However, their specific roles in EOC have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to recognize potential prognostic markers and novel therapeutic targets for EOC. We constructed the ubiquitin-related signature risk model comprising HSP90AB1, FBXO9, SIGMAR1, STAT1, SH3KBP1, EPB41L2, DNAJB6, VPS18, PPM1G, AKAP12, FRK, and PYGB, specifically for patients with EOC. The high-risk model presented a worse prognosis, primarily associated with the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, ECM receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and actin cytoskeleton regulations. Analysis of the immune landscape revealed a higher abundance of B cells, M2 macrophages, neutrophil CD4 T cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, macrophage neutrophils, and fibroblasts in the high-risk group. It also exhibited lower tumor mutation burden, mRNAsi, and EREG-mRNAsi and reduced sensitivity to other chemotherapy drugs, except dasatinib. These findings serve as a valuable indicator for personalized treatment strategies and clinical stratification in managing patients with EOC. Additionally, our study will serve as a foundation for future mechanistic research to explore the association between the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and EOC.",
Association of abnormal P-wave parameters with all-cause mortality in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"Hanzhi Du, Qinghua Tang, Yuye Ning, Huaiyu Wang, Zeqiang Nie, Mengchang Wang, Junjun Hao",2024-11-28,"Patients diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are at increased risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF). Abnormal P-wave parameters (PWPs) have been identified as independent predictors of AF, however, their prognostic significance in DLBCL patients remains unknown. Newly diagnosed DLBCL patients from January 2015 to August 2022 were retrospectively included in this study. Patients were devided as with abnormal PWPs or without it. Primary outcome was the all-cause mortality. The median duration of follow-up was 16.3 months. The Kaplan‒Meier method and multivariable COX proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the relationship between PWPs and all-cause mortality. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors associated with PWPs. A total of 374 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients were included, of whom 137 patients exhibited abnormalities in PWPs. Compared to the group with normal PWPs, patients with PWPs abnormalities had a higher proportion of males (p = 0.001), elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (p = 0.038) and blood creatinine (p = 0.005), and a higher rate of all-cause mortality (p = 0.001). PWPs, particularly P-wave duration (p = 0.017) and P-wave terminal force in lead V1 (PTFV1) (p = 0.001), were independently correlated with all-cause mortality in DLBCL patients. Furthermore, male patients exhibited a higher susceptibility to abnormal PWPs (p = 0.001). PWPs, particularly P-wave duration and PTFV1, serve as simple yet effective prognostic indicators for all-cause mortality in DLBCL patients. Consequently, vigilant monitoring of PWPs, particularly in male patients, is warranted to accurately evaluate the prognosis of DLBCL.","Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Atrial fibrillation, P-wave parameters, Prognosis"
Population data study reveals pain as a possible protective factor against cerebrovascular disease in cancer patients,"Yongbao Wei, Deng Lin, Yangpeng Lian, Qichen Wei, Longbao Zheng, Kun Yuan, Jiayang Zhao, Kaijin Kuang, Yuanyuan Tang, Yunliang Gao",2024-11-27,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between chronic pain and the mortality rate of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in cancer patients. Thus, we performed a case-control investigation was conducted by utilizing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1975 and 2019. Multiple demographics, pain rating and other clinical characteristics were extracted to assess predictors for the death from CVD in cancer patients. Different machine learning algorithms were applied to construct pain-related prediction model. The analysis involved 16,850 case patients and 710,729 controls. Among cancer patients, approximately 2.3% succumbed to subsequent CVD. Cancer pain (Pain rating II) was associated with a decreased risk of CVD. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses indicated that older age at cancer diagnosis, male gender, single marital status, Black or Other race, and lack of systemic therapy correlated with a higher risk of CVD-related death. Propensity score matching revealed a significantly lower proportion of Pain rating II in the case group. The logistic regression algorithm demonstrated superior predictive ability for 5-year and 10-year CVD risk in cancer patients. Notably, survival time, age, and pain rating emerged as the top three crucial variables. This study firstly investigated pain and various risk factors for CVD in cancer patients, highlighting pain as a novel and possible protective factor for CVD. The development of a risk model based on pain could aid in identifying individuals at high risk for CVD and may inspire innovative strategies for preventing CVD in cancer patients.","Cancer, Mortality, Cerebrovascular disease, Death cause, Risk of death"
Immuno-metabolic dendritic cell vaccine signatures associate with overall survival in vaccinated melanoma patients,"Juraj Adamik, Paul V. Munson, Deena M. Maurer, Felix J. Hartmann, Sean C. Bendall, Rafael J. Argüello, Lisa H. Butterfield",2023-11-08,"Efficacy of cancer vaccines remains low and mechanistic understanding of antigen presenting cell function in cancer may improve vaccine design and outcomes. Here, we analyze the transcriptomic and immune-metabolic profiles of Dendritic Cells (DCs) from 35 subjects enrolled in a trial of DC vaccines in late-stage melanoma (NCT01622933). Multiple platforms identify metabolism as an important biomarker of DC function and patient overall survival (OS). We demonstrate multiple immune and metabolic gene expression pathway alterations, a functional decrease in OCR/OXPHOS and increase in ECAR/glycolysis in patient vaccines. To dissect molecular mechanisms, we utilize single cell SCENITH functional profiling and show patient clinical outcomes (OS) correlate with DC metabolic profile, and that metabolism is linked to immune phenotype. With single cell metabolic regulome profiling, we show that MCT1 (monocarboxylate transporter-1), a lactate transporter, is increased in patient DCs, as is glucose uptake and lactate secretion. Importantly, pre-vaccination circulating myeloid cells in patients used as precursors for DC vaccine generation are significantly skewed metabolically as are several DC subsets. Together, we demonstrate that the metabolic profile of DC is tightly associated with the immunostimulatory potential of DC vaccines from cancer patients. We link phenotypic and functional metabolic changes to immune signatures that correspond to suppressed DC differentiation.",
18F-NaF uptake in skull-base bone as a predictor of treatment response in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Xingyu Mu, Jingze Li, Jingquan Huang, Zhenzhen Wang, Zuguo Li, Xun Li, Yu Jiang, Zhipeng Zhou, Wei Fu",2024-11-27,"This study investigates the utility of 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in assessing skull-base bone invasion (SBBI) and predicting treatment response in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A retrospective analysis was conducted on 142 patients with newly diagnosed advanced NPC who underwent 18F-NaF PET/CT for initial staging from December 2020 to December 2023. 18F-NaF PET/CT scans were analyzed for uptake values at the skull-base bone, and these were correlated with treatment outcomes of primary tumor using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Statistical analyses involved Mann–Whitney U tests for group comparisons and logistic regression for evaluating risk factors. Higher 18F-NaF uptake at the skull-base bone was significantly associated with advanced T stages (p < 0.0001) and the presence of bone metastases (p = 0.01). Patients exhibiting complete response (CR) to treatment had significantly lower skull-base 18F-NaF uptake compared to those with non-CR (p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified an SUVmax > 10.0 and SUVmean > 5.2 as predictive of non-CR, with AUC values of 0.77 and 0.76, respectively. Univariate and multivariable analysis confirmed SUVmax as a significant predictor of treatment response (OR = 7.03, 95% CI: 1.97–25.13, p < 0.05). Elevated 18F-NaF uptake at the skull-base bone is predictive of poorer treatment outcomes, highlighting its potential as a prognostic biomarker in advanced NPC. This study demonstrates that 18F-NaF PET/CT is a valuable imaging modality for evaluating SBBI in NPC, offering metabolic information that complements the anatomical findings from MRI.","18F-NaF, PET/CT, Skull-base bone invasion, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Treatment response"
Sanguinarine identified as a natural dual inhibitor of AURKA and CDK2 through network pharmacology and bioinformatics approaches,"Xiang Li, Qi You",2024-11-28,"Cervical cancer (CA) continues to be a female malignant tumor with limited therapeutic options, resulting in a high mortality rate. Sanguinarine (SANG), a naturally occurring alkaloid, has demonstrated notable efficacy in preclinical treatment of CA. However, the mechanism through which SANG acts against CA is not fully understood. To address this, utilizing nine drug target prediction databases, we have successfully identified 379 potential targets for SANG. Venn diagram analysis compared 2367 CA-related targets from the GeneCards disease database, 2618 CA-closely related targets derived from multiple datasets in GEO through WGCNA analysis, and the 379 potential targets of SANG, resulting in 35 shared targets. Subsequently, by employing PPI network analysis, the Cytohubba plugin, the Human Protein Atlas, TCGA database data, and ROC curve analysis, we have identified AURKA and CDK2 as key targets of SANG in combating CA. Single-gene GSEA results suggest that the overexpression of AURKA and CDK2 is closely correlated with DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and various DNA repair pathways in CA. Molecular docking and molecular simulation dynamics analyses have confirmed the stable binding of both AURKA and CDK2 to SANG. In summary, by integrating diverse methodological approaches, this study discovered that SANG potentially inhibits the malignant features of CA by targeting AURKA and CDK2, thereby regulating DNA replication, cell cycle progression, and multiple DNA repair pathways. This lays a solid foundation for further exploring the pharmacological role of SANG in CA therapy. However, further in-depth in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to corroborate our findings.","Cervical cancer, Sanguinarine, Weighted gene co-expression network analysis, Molecular dynamics simulation, AURKA, CDK2"
Epigenome-wide impact of MAT2A sustains the androgen-indifferent state and confers synthetic vulnerability in ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer,"Alessia Cacciatore, Dheeraj Shinde, Carola Musumeci, Giada Sandrini, Luca Guarrera, Domenico Albino, Gianluca Civenni, Elisa Storelli, Simone Mosole, Elisa Federici, Alessio Fusina, Marta Iozzo, Andrea Rinaldi, Matteo Pecoraro, Roger Geiger, Marco Bolis, Carlo V. Catapano, Giuseppina M. Carbone",2024-08-06,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is a frequently occurring disease with adverse clinical outcomes and limited therapeutic options. Here, we identify methionine adenosyltransferase 2a (MAT2A) as a critical driver of the androgen-indifferent state in ERG fusion-positive CRPC. MAT2A is upregulated in CRPC and cooperates with ERG in promoting cell plasticity, stemness and tumorigenesis. RNA, ATAC and ChIP-sequencing coupled with histone post-translational modification analysis by mass spectrometry show that MAT2A broadly impacts the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape. MAT2A enhances H3K4me2 at multiple genomic sites, promoting the expression of pro-tumorigenic non-canonical AR target genes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of MAT2A reverses the transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling in CRPC models and improves the response to AR and EZH2 inhibitors. These data reveal a role of MAT2A in epigenetic reprogramming and provide a proof of concept for testing MAT2A inhibitors in CRPC patients to improve clinical responses and prevent treatment resistance.",
Analysis of four long non-coding RNAs for hepatocellular carcinoma screening and prognosis by the aid of machine learning techniques,"Ahmed Samir, Amira Abdeldaim, Ammar Mohammed, Asmaa Ali, Mohamed Alorabi, Mariam M. Hussein, Yasser Mabrouk Bakr, Asmaa Mohamed Ibrahim, Ahmed Samir Abdelhafiz",2024-11-28,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a significant health burden in Egypt, largely attributable to the endemic prevalence of hepatitis B and C viruses. Early identification of HCC remains a challenge due to the lack of widespread screening among at-risk populations. The objective of this study was to assess the utility of machine learning in predicting HCC by analyzing the combined expression of lncRNAs and conventional laboratory biomarkers. Plasma levels of four lncRNAs (LINC00152, LINC00853, UCA1, and GAS5) were quantified in a cohort of 52 HCC patients and 30 age-matched controls. The individual diagnostic performance of each lncRNA was assessed using ROC curve analysis. Subsequently, a machine learning model was constructed using Python’s Scikit-learn platform to integrate these lncRNAs with additional clinical laboratory parameters for HCC diagnosis. Individual lncRNAs exhibited moderate diagnostic accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 60 to 83% and 53–67%, respectively. In contrast, the machine learning model demonstrated superior performance, achieving 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Notably, a higher LINC00152 to GAS5 expression ratio significantly correlated with increased mortality risk. The integration of lncRNA biomarkers with conventional laboratory data within a machine learning framework demonstrates significant potential for developing a precise and cost-effective diagnostic tool for HCC. To enhance the model’s robustness and prognostic capabilities, future studies should incorporate larger cohorts and explore a wider array of lncRNAs.","HCC, lncRNAs, Machine learning, Screening"
"Normal weight obesity, circulating biomarkers and risk of breast cancer: a prospective cohort study and meta-analysis","Wenjie Wang, Xiaoyan Wang, Ying Jiang, Yingying Guo, Peifen Fu, Wei He, Xiaohua Fu",2024-11-28,"BackgroundIndividuals with normal weight obesity (NWO) often escape the attention of healthcare providers who may assume that a normal body mass index (BMI) correlates with low health risks. However, it remains unknown whether NWO increases the risk of breast cancer.MethodsThis study included 22,257 and 52,506 pre- and postmenopausal females with normal BMI in the UK Biobank. NWO was defined as participants with a normal BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m2) and an excess percent body fat (PBF > 33.3%). Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the associations of NWO and NWO-related biomarkers with incident breast cancer.ResultsNWO was not associated with premenopausal breast cancer, whereas it was associated with a higher risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (hazard ratio = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08–1.31). In our meta-analysis, per 5-unit increment in percent body fat level was linked to a 15% (95% CI: 10–19%) elevated risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in females with normal BMI. Stratified analyses showed a stronger positive association in females with higher genetic risk. In our NWO-biomarkers analyses, NWO was linked to 34 identified biomarkers, of which three inflammation markers (monocyte count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein), and one ketone body metabolite (β-Hydroxybutyrate) also indicated a positive association with postmenopausal breast cancer.ConclusionsNWO is associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer, indicating that relying solely on BMI neglects the higher risk faced by non-obese postmenopausal women.",
"Efficacy and safety of dual blockade of HER2 and PD-1 in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer: a retrospective, multicentre study","Shuyi Cen, Meiqin Yuan, Qunan Sun, Guilan Hou, Jieer Ying, Qi Xu, Yu Zheng, Ying Dong, Hongming Pan, Weidong Han",2024-10-23,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression is one of the most important pathological characteristics of gastric cancer. The positive rate of HER2 expression in patients with gastric cancer is approximately 20%. The phase III Keynote-811 study revealed that anti-HER2 and anti-PD-1 therapy combined with chemotherapy could significantly improve the objective response rate as first-line treatment in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric cancer. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with trastuzumab and PD-1 inhibitors in patients with advanced HER2-positive gastric cancer in a real-world setting. Seventy-two HER2-positive gastric cancer patients from three hospitals in China were retrospectively reviewed. These patients were treated with trastuzumab plus one anti-PD-1 agent with or without chemotherapy. The overall response rate, progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1). From January 2018 to October 2021, 72 patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer received trastuzumab and a PD-1 inhibitor with or without chemotherapy as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, first-line therapy, second-line therapy or salvage therapy. The ORR was 54.2% for all patients and 79.4% for previously untreated patients. The median PFS and median OS were 10 months (95% CI: 8–13 months) and 26.1 months (95% CI: 18.5-NA months), respectively, for all patients. Grade 3 adverse effects occurred in approximately 25% of patients. Immune-related adverse effects occurred in approximately 12.5% of patients.

Gasdermin-E-mediated pyroptosis drives immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis via cGAS-STING activation,"Si-Jia Sun, Xiao-Dong Jiao, Zhi-Gang Chen, Qi Cao, Jia-Hui Zhu, Qi-Rui Shen, Yi Liu, Zhen Zhang, Fang-Fang Xu, Yu Shi, Jie Tong, Shen-Xi Ouyang, Jiang-Tao Fu, Yi Zhao, Jun Ren, Dong-Jie Li, Fu-Ming Shen, Pei Wang",2024-08-05,"Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced myocarditis involves intensive immune/inflammation activation; however, its molecular basis is unclear. Here, we show that gasdermin-E (GSDME), a gasdermin family member, drives ICI-induced myocarditis. Pyroptosis mediated by GSDME, but not the canonical GSDMD, is activated in myocardial tissue of mice and cancer patients with ICI-induced myocarditis. Deficiency of GSDME in male mice alleviates ICI-induced cardiac infiltration of T cells, macrophages, and monocytes, as well as mitochondrial damage and inflammation. Restoration of GSDME expression specifically in cardiomyocytes, rather than myeloid cells, in GSDME-deficient mice reproduces ICI-induced myocarditis. Mechanistically, quantitative proteomics reveal that GSDME-dependent pyroptosis promotes cell death and mitochondrial DNA release, which in turn activates cGAS-STING signaling, triggering a robust interferon response and myocardial immune/inflammation activation. Pharmacological blockade of GSDME attenuates ICI-induced myocarditis and improves long-term survival in mice. Our findings may advance the understanding of ICI-induced myocarditis and suggest that targeting the GSDME-cGAS-STING-interferon axis may help prevent and manage ICI-associated myocarditis.",
Sema3C signaling is an alternative activator of the canonical WNT pathway in glioblastoma,"Jing Hao, Xiangzi Han, Haidong Huang, Xingjiang Yu, Jiankang Fang, Jianjun Zhao, Richard A. Prayson, Shideng Bao, Jennifer S. Yu",2023-04-20,"The Wnt pathway is frequently dysregulated in many cancers, underscoring it as a therapeutic target. Wnt inhibitors have uniformly failed in clinical trials. Here, we report a mechanism of WNT pathway activation through the Semaphorin 3 C neurodevelopmental program in glioma stem-like cells. Sema3C directs β-catenin nuclear accumulation in a Rac1-dependent process, leading to transactivation of Wnt target genes. Sema3C-driven Wnt signaling occurred despite suppression of Wnt ligand secretion, suggesting that Sema3C drives canonical Wnt signaling independent of Wnt ligand binding. In a mouse model of glioblastoma, combined depletion of Sema3C and β-catenin partner TCF1 extended animal survival more than single target inhibition alone. In human glioblastoma, Sema3C expression and Wnt pathway activation were highly concordant. Since Sema3C is frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma, Sema3C signaling may be a significant mechanism of resistance to upstream Wnt pathway inhibitors. Dual targeting of Sema3C and Wnt pathways may achieve clinically significant Wnt pathway inhibition.",
Hepatic stellate cell stearoyl co-A desaturase activates leukotriene B4 receptor 2 - β-catenin cascade to promote liver tumorigenesis,"Sonal Sinha, Satoka Aizawa, Yasuhiro Nakano, Alexander Rialdi, Hye Yeon Choi, Rajan Shrestha, Stephanie Q.

Activated hepatic stellate cells (aHSC) give rise to cancer-associated fibroblasts in HCC and are considered a potential therapeutic target. Here we report that selective ablation of stearoyl CoA desaturase-2 (Scd2) in aHSC globally suppresses nuclear CTNNB1 and YAP1 in tumors and tumor microenvironment and prevents liver tumorigenesis in male mice. Tumor suppression is associated with reduced leukotriene B4 receptor 2 (LTB4R2) and its high affinity oxylipin ligand, 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHTrE). Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of LTB4R2 recapitulates CTNNB1 and YAP1 inactivation and tumor suppression in culture and in vivo. Single cell RNA sequencing identifies a subset of tumor-associated aHSC expressing Cyp1b1 but no other 12-HHTrE biosynthetic genes. aHSC release 12-HHTrE in a manner dependent on SCD and CYP1B1 and their conditioned medium reproduces the LTB4R2-mediated tumor-promoting effects of 12-HHTrE in HCC cells. CYP1B1-expressing aHSC are detected in proximity of LTB4R2-positive HCC cells and the growth of patient HCC organoids is blunted by LTB4R2 antagonism or knockdown. Collectively, our findings suggest aHSC-initiated 12-HHTrE-LTB4R2-CTNNB1-YAP1 pathway as a potential HCC therapeutic target.",

This study included 123 patients presenting between 2017 and 2019 with typical/atypical lung carcinoids (Cohort 1), G1/2 gastrointestinal (Cohort 2), G1/2 pancreatic (Cohort 3) and G3 gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) (Cohort 4) NENs; who progressed to standard therapies. Patients received 1500 mg durvalumab and 75 mg tremelimumab for up to 13 and 4 cycles (every 4 weeks), respectively. The primary objective was the 9-month clinical benefit rate (CBR) for cohorts 1-3 and 9-month overall survival (OS) rate for Cohort 4. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, duration of response, progression-free survival according to irRECIST, overall survival, and safety. Correlation of PD-L1 expression with efficacy was exploratory. The 9-month CBR was 25.9%/35.5%/25% for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The 9-month OS rate for Cohort 4 was 36.1%, surpassing the futility threshold. Benefit in Cohort 4 was observed regardless of differentiation and Ki67 levels. PD-L1 combined scores did not correlate with treatment activity. Safety profile was consistent with that of prior studies.

Here we report the identification of TINCR as a tumor suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). TINCR is upregulated by UV-induced DNA damage in a TP53-dependent manner in human keratinocytes. Decreased TINCR protein expression is prevalently found in skin and head and neck squamous cell tumors and TINCR expression suppresses the growth of SCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, Tincr knockout mice show accelerated tumor development following UVB skin carcinogenesis and increased penetrance of invasive SCCs. Finally, genetic analyses identify loss-of-function mutations and deletions encompassing the TINCR gene in SCC clinical samples supporting a tumor suppressor role in human cancer. Altogether, these results demonstrate a role for TINCR as protein coding tumor suppressor gene recurrently lost in squamous cell carcinomas.",

Davis",2023-05-22,"Resistance to glucocorticoids (GC) is associated with an increased risk of relapse in B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Performing transcriptomic and single-cell proteomic studies in healthy B-cell progenitors, we herein identify coordination between the glucocorticoid receptor pathway with B-cell developmental pathways. Healthy pro-B cells most highly express the glucocorticoid receptor, and this developmental expression is conserved in primary BCP-ALL cells from patients at diagnosis and relapse. In-vitro and in vivo glucocorticoid treatment of primary BCP-ALL cells demonstrate that the interplay between B-cell development and the glucocorticoid pathways is crucial for GC resistance in leukemic cells. Gene set enrichment analysis in BCP-ALL cell lines surviving GC treatment show enrichment of B cell receptor signaling pathways. In addition, primary BCP-ALL cells surviving GC treatment in vitro and in vivo demonstrate a late pre-B cell phenotype with activation of PI3K/mTOR and CREB signaling. Dasatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, most effectively targets this active signaling in GC-resistant cells, and when combined with glucocorticoids, results in increased cell death in vitro and decreased leukemic burden and prolonged survival in an in vivo xenograft model. Targeting the active signaling through the addition of dasatinib may represent a therapeutic approach to overcome GC resistance in BCP-ALL.",
RETRACTED ARTICLE: Polymerase θ inhibition activates the cGAS-STING pathway and cooperates with immune checkpoint blockade in models of BRCA-deficient cancer,"Jeffrey Patterson-Fortin, Heta Jadhav, Constantia Pantelidou, Tin Phan, Carter Grochala, Anita K. Mehta, Jennifer L. Guerriero, Gerburg M. Wulf, Brian M. Wolpin, Ben Z. Stanger, Andrew J. Aguirre, James M. Cleary, Alan D. D’Andrea, Geoffrey I. Shapiro",2023-03-13,"Recently developed inhibitors of polymerase theta (POLθ) have demonstrated synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient tumor models. To examine the contribution of the immune microenvironment to antitumor efficacy, we characterized the effects of POLθ inhibition in immunocompetent models of BRCA1-deficient triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) or BRCA2-deficient pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We demonstrate that genetic POLQ depletion or pharmacological POLθ inhibition induces both innate and adaptive immune responses in these models. POLθ inhibition resulted in increased micronuclei, cGAS/STING pathway activation, type I interferon gene expression, CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation, local paracrine activation of dendritic cells and upregulation of PD-L1 expression. Depletion of CD8+ T cells compromised the efficacy of POLθ inhibition, whereas antitumor effects were augmented in combination with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that POLθ inhibition induces immune responses in a cGAS/STING-dependent manner and provide a rationale for combining POLθ inhibition with immune checkpoint blockade for the treatment of HR-deficient cancers.",
Histopathology images predict multi-omics aberrations and prognoses in colorectal cancer patients,"Pei-Chen Tsai, Tsung-Hua Lee, Kun-Chi Kuo, Fang-Yi Su, Tsung-Lu Michael Lee, Eliana Marostica, Tomotaka Ugai, Melissa Zhao, Mai Chan Lau, Juha P.

Chan, Jung-Hsien Chiang, Jonathan Nowak, Shuji Ogino, Kun-Hsing Yu",2023-04-13,"Histopathologic assessment is indispensable for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, manual evaluation of the diseased tissues under the microscope cannot reliably inform patient prognosis or genomic variations crucial for treatment selections. To address these challenges, we develop the Multi-omics Multi-cohort Assessment (MOMA) platform, an explainable machine learning approach, to systematically identify and interpret the relationship between patients’ histologic patterns, multi-omics, and clinical profiles in three large patient cohorts (n = 1888). MOMA successfully predicts the overall survival, disease-free survival (log-rank test P-value<0.05), and copy number alterations of CRC patients. In addition, our approaches identify interpretable pathology patterns predictive of gene expression profiles, microsatellite instability status, and clinically actionable genetic alterations. We show that MOMA models are generalizable to multiple patient populations with different demographic compositions and pathology images collected from distinctive digitization methods. Our machine learning approaches provide clinically actionable predictions that could inform treatments for colorectal cancer patients.",
ADAR1-mediated RNA editing of SCD1 drives drug resistance and self-renewal in gastric cancer,"Tin-Lok Wong, Jia-Jian Loh, Shixun Lu, Helen H. N. Yan, Hoi Cheong Siu, Ren Xi, Dessy Chan, Max J. F. Kam, Lei Zhou, Man Tong, John A. Copland, Leilei Chen, Jing-Ping Yun, Suet Yi Leung, Stephanie Ma",2023-05-19,"Targetable drivers governing 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (5FU + CDDP) resistance remain elusive due to the paucity of physiologically and therapeutically relevant models. Here, we establish 5FU + CDDP resistant intestinal subtype GC patient-derived organoid lines. JAK/STAT signaling and its downstream, adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1), are shown to be concomitantly upregulated in the resistant lines. ADAR1 confers chemoresistance and self-renewal in an RNA editing-dependent manner. WES coupled with RNA-seq identify enrichment of hyper-edited lipid metabolism genes in the resistant lines. Mechanistically, ADAR1-mediated A-to-I editing on 3’UTR of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1) increases binding of KH domain-containing, RNA-binding, signal transduction-associated 1 (KHDRBS1), thereby augmenting SCD1 mRNA stability. Consequently, SCD1 facilitates lipid droplet formation to alleviate chemotherapy-induced ER stress and enhances self-renewal through increasing β-catenin expression. Pharmacological inhibition of SCD1 abrogates chemoresistance and tumor-initiating cell frequency. Clinically, high proteomic level of ADAR1 and SCD1, or high SCD1 editing/ADAR1 mRNA signature score predicts a worse prognosis. Together, we unveil a potential target to circumvent chemoresistance.",
Transcriptomic profiles and 5-year results from the randomized CLL14 study of venetoclax plus obinutuzumab versus chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"Othman Al-Sawaf, Can Zhang, Hyun Yong Jin, Sandra Robrecht, Yoonha Choi, Sandhya Balasubramanian, Alex Kotak, Yi Meng Chang, Anna Maria Fink, Eugen Tausch, Christof Schneider, Matthias Ritgen, Karl-Anton Kreuzer, Brenda Chyla, Joseph N.

In this open-label parallel-group phase-3 study, 432 patients with previously untreated CLL were randomized (1:1) to receive either 1-year venetoclax-obinutuzumab (Ven-Obi, 216 patients) or chlorambucil-Obi (Clb-Obi, 216 patients) therapy (NCT02242942). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints included minimal residual disease (MRD) and overall survival. RNA sequencing of CD19-enriched blood was conducted for exploratory post-hoc analyses. After a median follow-up of 65.4 months, PFS is significantly superior for Ven-Obi compared to Clb-Obi (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.35 [95% CI 0.26–0.46], p < 0.0001). At 5 years after randomization, the estimated PFS rate is 62.6% after Ven-Obi and 27.0% after Clb-Obi. In both arms, MRD status at the end of therapy is associated with longer PFS. MRD + ( ≥ 10−4) status is associated with increased expression of multi-drug resistance gene ABCB1 (MDR1), whereas MRD6 (< 10−6) is associated with BCL2L11 (BIM) expression. Inflammatory response pathways are enriched in MRD+ patient solely in the Ven-Obi arm. These data indicate sustained long-term efficacy of fixed-duration Ven-Obi in patients with previously untreated CLL. The distinct transcriptomic profile of MRD+ status suggests possible biological vulnerabilities.",
Using a pan-cancer atlas to investigate tumour associated macrophages as regulators of immunotherapy response,"Alexander Coulton, Jun Murai, Danwen Qian, Krupa Thakkar, Claire E. Lewis, Kevin Litchfield",2024-07-06,"The paradigm for macrophage characterization has evolved from the simple M1/M2 dichotomy to a more complex model that encompasses the broad spectrum of macrophage phenotypic diversity, due to differences in ontogeny and/or local stimuli. We currently lack an in-depth pan-cancer single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) atlas of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) that fully captures this complexity. In addition, an increased understanding of macrophage diversity could help to explain the variable responses of cancer patients to immunotherapy. Our atlas includes well established macrophage subsets as well as a number of additional ones. We associate macrophage composition with tumour phenotype and show macrophage subsets can vary between primary and metastatic tumours growing in sites like the liver. We also examine macrophage-T cell functional cross talk and identify two subsets of TAMs associated with T cell activation. Analysis of TAM signatures in a large cohort of immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated patients (CPI1000 + ) identify multiple TAM subsets associated with response, including the presence of a subset of TAMs that upregulate collagen-related genes. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our data as a resource and reference atlas for mapping of novel macrophage datasets using projection. Overall, these advances represent an important step in both macrophage classification and overcoming resistance to immunotherapies in cancer.",
Transcriptional control of CBX5 by the RNA-binding proteins RBMX and RBMXL1 maintains chromatin state in myeloid leukemia,"Camila Prieto, Diu T. T.

Kharas",2021-07-05,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key arbiters of post-transcriptional regulation and are found to be dysregulated in hematological malignancies. Here we identify the RBP RNA-binding motif protein, X-linked (RBMX; also known as hnRNPG), and its retrogene RBMXL1 to be required for murine and human myeloid leukemogenesis. RBMX and RBMXL1 were overexpressed in individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to healthy individuals, and RBMX/RBMXL1 loss delayed leukemia development. RBMX/RBMXL1 loss lead to global changes in chromatin accessibility as well as chromosomal breaks and gaps. We found that RBMX and RBMXL1 directly bind to mRNAs, affect transcription of multiple loci, including CBX5 (also known as heterochromatin protein 1 alpha (HP1-α)), and control the nascent transcription of the CBX5 locus. Forced CBX5 expression rescued the RBMX/RBMXL1 depletion effects on cell growth and apoptosis. Overall, we determined that RBMX and RBMXL1 control leukemia cell survival by regulating chromatin state through the downstream target CBX5. These findings identify a mechanism for RBPs directly promoting transcription and suggest RBMX and RBMXL1, as well as CBX5, as potential therapeutic targets in myeloid malignancies.",
Construction and validation of a novel gene signature for predicting the prognosis of osteosarcoma,"Jinpo Yang, Anran Zhang, Huan Luo, Chao Ma",2022-01-24,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common type of primary malignant bone tumor. The high-throughput sequencing technology has shown potential abilities to illuminate the pathogenic genes in OS. This study was designed to find a powerful gene signature that can predict clinical outcomes. We selected OS cases with gene expression and survival data in the TARGET-OS dataset and GSE21257 datasets as training cohort and validation cohort, respectively. The univariate Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analysis were conducted to determine potential prognostic genes from the training cohort. These potential prognostic genes underwent a LASSO regression, which then generated a gene signature. The harvested signature’s predictive ability was further examined by the Kaplan–Meier analysis, Cox analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC curve). More importantly, we listed similar studies in the most recent year and compared theirs with ours. Finally, we performed functional annotation, immune relevant signature correlation identification, and immune infiltrating analysis to better study he functional mechanism of the signature and the immune cells’ roles in the gene signature’s prognosis ability. A seventeen-gene signature (UBE2L3, PLD3, SLC45A4, CLTC, CTNNBIP1, FBXL5, MKL2, SELPLG, C3orf14, WDR53, ZFP90, UHRF2, ARX, CORT, DDX26B, MYC, and SLC16A3) was generated from the LASSO regression. The signature was then confirmed having strong and stable prognostic capacity in all studied cohorts by several statistical methods. We revealed the superiority of our signature after comparing it to our predecessors, and the GO and KEGG annotations uncovered the specifically mechanism of action related to the gene signature. Six immune signatures, including PRF1, CD8A, HAVCR2, LAG3, CD274, and GZMA were identified associating with our signature. The immune-infiltrating analysis recognized the vital roles of T cells CD8 and Mast cells activated, which potentially support the seventeen-gene signature’s prognosis ability. We identified a robust seventeen-gene signature that can accurately predict OS prognosis. We identified potential immunotherapy targets to the gene signature. The T cells CD8 and Mast cells activated were identified linked with the seventeen-gene signature predictive power.",
Whole-genome profiling of nasopharyngeal carcinoma reveals viral-host co-operation in inflammatory NF-κB activation and immune escape,"Jeff P. Bruce, Ka-Fai To, Vivian W. Y. Lui, Grace T. Y.

Here we report a comprehensive genomic analysis of 70 NPCs, combining whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of microdissected tumor cells with EBV oncogene expression to reveal multiple aspects of cellular-viral co-operation in tumorigenesis. Genomic aberrations along with EBV-encoded LMP1 expression underpin constitutive NF-κB activation in 90% of NPCs. A similar spectrum of somatic aberrations and viral gene expression undermine innate immunity in 79% of cases and adaptive immunity in 47% of cases; mechanisms by which NPC may evade immune surveillance despite its pro-inflammatory phenotype. Additionally, genomic changes impairing TGFBR2 promote oncogenesis and stabilize EBV infection in tumor cells. Fine-mapping of CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion breakpoints reveals homozygous MTAP deletions in 32-34% of NPCs that confer marked sensitivity to MAT2A inhibition. Our work concludes that NPC is a homogeneously NF-κB-driven and immune-protected, yet potentially druggable, cancer.",

Of 15 patients enrolled, 12 (80%) underwent successful margin-negative resection and 5 out of 12 (42%) had major pathological responses. In-depth biospecimen profiling demonstrated an enrichment in effector T cells, as well as tertiary lymphoid structures, CD138+ plasma cells, and a distinct spatial arrangement of B cells in responders compared to nonresponders, indicating an orchestrated B cell contribution to antitumor immunity in HCC.",
"Inhibition of histone acetyltransferase function radiosensitizes CREBBP/EP300 mutants via repression of homologous recombination, potentially targeting a gain of function","Manish Kumar, David Molkentine, Jessica Molkentine, Kathleen Bridges, Tongxin Xie, Liangpeng Yang, Andrew Hefner, Meng Gao, Reshub Bahri, Annika Dhawan, Mitchell J.

Herein we perform in vivo shRNA screening to identify targets generally associated with radiation response as well as those exhibiting a genomic dependency. This identifies the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP/EP300 as a target for radiosensitization in combination with radiation in cognate mutant tumors. Further in vitro and in vivo studies confirm this phenomenon to be due to repression of homologous recombination following DNA damage and reproducible using chemical inhibition of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), but not bromodomain function. Selected mutations in CREBBP lead to a hyperacetylated state that increases CBP and BRCA1 acetylation, representing a gain of function targeted by HAT inhibition. Additionally, mutations in CREBBP/EP300 are associated with recurrence following radiation in squamous cell carcinoma cohorts. These findings provide both a mechanism of resistance and the potential for genomically-driven treatment.",
Imaging-guided precision hyperthermia with magnetic nanoparticles,"Ali Shakeri-Zadeh, Jeff W. M. Bulte",2024-11-07,"Magnetic nanoparticles, including those formed of superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIOs), are employed in various magnetic imaging and therapeutic techniques. In vivo imaging techniques based on the detection of magnetic nanoparticles inside the body include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic particle imaging (MPI), magneto-motive ultrasonography (MMUS) and magneto-photoacoustic imaging (MPAI). Preclinical data indicate that the conditions required to heat up magnetic nanoparticles, including energy considerations, particle modifications, localization and exposure time, can be dynamically modulated during a single treatment procedure by monitoring imaging data acquired from the same magnetic nanoparticles. This Review explores the potential use of magnetic-nanoparticle-mediated imaging techniques combined with magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) to selectively and precisely heat tumour locations while avoiding damage to surrounding healthy tissue. Imaging-guided MFH could provide individualized treatment plans based on information about the biodistribution of magnetic nanoparticles within the tumour and adjacent organs, as well as the volumetric distribution of the thermal dose. Requirements for the clinical translation of MFH-enabled magnetic imaging techniques are also discussed — the development of magnetic nanoparticle formulations with a favourable biosafety profile, optimal magnetic heating properties and maximal magnetic imaging signals; and the integration of magnetic imaging and heating hardware into a single platform.",
Toxicity profile of camrelizumab-based immunotherapy in older adults with advanced cancer,"Hong Zhou, Li-Li Cai, Yan-Fang Lin, Jun-Jie Ma",2024-08-16,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become an important cornerstone of many tumour treatments. However, the toxicity profile of immune-chemotherapy combination treatment approaches among older adult cancer patients is still unclear. Patients with any cancer who received camrelizumab-based immunotherapy were eligible for inclusion. The primary endpoints were adverse events (AEs) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which were defined based on Naranjo's algorithm. Patients were stratified by age (≥ 70 years and < 70 years), and comparisons were made based on the type of camrelizumab-based therapy (monotherapy, combined chemotherapy, or combined anti-VEGF therapy). A total of 185 patients were administered camrelizumab-based immunotherapy, 55 (30%) of whom were ≥ 70 years old. A total of 146 (78.9%) patients received camrelizumab-based combination treatment. The incidence of all-grade AEs was 56.8% (105 patients), while that of irAEs was 36.8% (68 patients). There was no difference in the percentage of patients experiencing any grade or grade ≥ 3 AEs between age groups. However, the frequency of irAEs (both any grade and grade ≥ 3) significantly differed by age group (P = 0.001 and 0.009, respectively). The results of multivariable analysis revealed that age ≥ 70 years was the only independent risk factor for irAEs. The results of subgroup analysis revealed that the incidence of irAEs was higher in older patients treated with camrelizumab-chemotherapy, while the incidence rates were similar between age groups in the monotherapy and combination anti-VEGF treatment subgroups. Immune-related diabetes mellitus occurred more frequently among older adults. The spectrum of irAEs showed that combination immunotherapy had more widely effects on the organ system than monotherapy. In this study, older (≥ 70 years) patients had a higher risk of all-grade and high-grade irAEs when receiving camrelizumab chemotherapy combination treatment. Notably, long-term random glucose monitoring should be performed during ICI-based immunotherapy in older cancer patients.","Immune checkpoint inhibitors, Ageing, Immunotherapy, Cancer, Toxicity"
Guadecitabine plus ipilimumab in unresectable melanoma: five-year follow-up and integrated multi-omic analysis in the phase 1b NIBIT-M4 trial,"Teresa Maria Rosaria Noviello, Anna Maria Di Giacomo, Francesca Pia Caruso, Alessia Covre, Roberta Mortarini, Giovanni Scala, Maria Claudia Costa, Sandra Coral, Wolf H.

The NIBIT-M4 was a phase Ib, dose-escalation trial in patients with advanced melanoma of the hypomethylating agent guadecitabine combined with the anti-CTLA-4 antibody ipilimumab that followed a traditional 3 + 3 design (NCT02608437). Patients received guadecitabine 30, 45 or 60 mg/m2/day subcutaneously on days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks starting on week 0 for a total of four cycles, and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously starting on day 1 of week 1 every 3 weeks for a total of four cycles. Primary outcomes of safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of treatment were previously reported. Here we report the 5-year clinical outcome for the secondary endpoints of overall survival, progression free survival, and duration of response, and an exploratory integrated multi-omics analysis on pre- and on-treatment tumor biopsies. With a minimum follow-up of 45 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 28.9% and the median duration of response was 20.6 months. Re-expression of immuno-modulatory endogenous retroviruses and of other repetitive elements, and a mechanistic signature of guadecitabine are associated with response. Integration of a genetic immunoediting index with an adaptive immunity signature stratifies patients/lesions into four distinct subsets and discriminates 5-year overall survival and progression free survival. These results suggest that coupling genetic immunoediting with activation of adaptive immunity is a relevant requisite for achieving long term clinical benefit by epigenetic immunomodulation in advanced melanoma patients.",
The predictive role of intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurement on postoperative parathyroid function in patients undergoing total thyroidectomy,"Yushuai Zhang, Yishen Zhao, Hong Tang, Hongrui Zou, Yang Li, Xuehai Bian, Jie Tan, Yingying Wang",2024-11-26,"Hypocalcemia is a common complication of thyroidectomy, particularly total thyroidectomy. The higher incidence of hypocalcemia following total thyroidectomy is primarily due to inadvertent damage to the parathyroid glands during surgery. This study aims to investigate the predictive value of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) in determining hypocalcemia during hospitalization and the recovery of parathyroid function after total thyroidectomy, as well as the factors that may influence IOPTH. In this retrospective study, we analyzed a cohort of 164 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy at our institution between 2018 and 2019. IOPTH was measured either 15 min after bilateral thyroidectomy combined with area VI lymph node dissection, or 15 min after bilateral thyroidectomy alone. We plotted ROC curves for IOPTH and ΔPTH% in relation to hypocalcemia during hospitalization and recovery of parathyroid function. Additionally, we explored risk factors for the development of hypocalcemia during hospitalization and factors that may influence IOPTH. IOPTH and ΔPTH% demonstrated good specificity and sensitivity for predicting hypocalcemia during hospitalization and for assessing recovery of parathyroid function. Lower preoperative PTH levels, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and intraoperative parathyroid auto-transplantation were identified as risk factors for IOPTH < 15 pg/mL. IOPTH and ΔPTH% are predictive of hypocalcemia during the postoperative hospital stay and recovery of parathyroid function. Patients with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, intraoperative parathyroid auto-transplantation, and low preoperative PTH levels should be closely monitored for the recovery of parathyroid function after surgery.","Total thyroidectomy, IOPTH, Hypocalcemia, Hypoparathyroidism, Recovery of parathyroid function"
The expression and clinical significance of ARHGAP25 in osteosarcoma based on bioinformatics analysis,"Xiaoqian Liu, Siyuan Zhang, Dong Wang, Kaili Lv, Yonggui Wang, Lei Peng",2024-08-12,"ARHGAP25, a member of the ARHGAP family, encodes a negative regulator of Rho-GTPase that is important for actin remodeling, cell polarity, and cell migration. ARHGAP25 is down-regulated in a variety of solid tumors and promotes cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion. However, nothing is understood about ARHGAP25’s biological function in osteosarcoma. This work used qPCR and WB to confirm the expression of ARHGAP25 in osteosarcoma following the initial analysis of its expression in pan-cancer. For GO and KEGG analysis, we have chosen 300 genes from the TARGET osteosarcoma data that had the strongest positive correlation with ARHGAP25, and we created nomogram and calibration charts. We simultaneously overexpressed ARHGAP25 in osteosarcoma cells to examine its impact on apoptosis and proliferation. By using MSP, we determined their methylation status in osteosarcoma cells and normal bone cells. We observed that ARHGAP25 was significantly downregulated in a range of malignancies, including osteosarcoma, and was associated with poor patient outcomes. The decrease of ARHGAP25 expression in osteosarcoma is related to DNA methylation. Overexpression of ARHGAP25 induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. In addition, ARHGAP25 is also associated with immune-related pathways in osteosarcoma. These findings suggest that ARHGAP25 is a valuable prognostic biomarker in osteosarcoma patients.","Osteosarcoma, ARHGAP25, Methylation, Biomarker"

Secondary endpoints included objective response rate, duration of response, survival outcomes (progression-free survival and overall survival), and safety. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, as the 24-week clinical benefit rate was not significantly improved by adding oleclumab (43% vs. 44%, p = 0.61).

Effects of tamoxifen on cognitive function in patients with primary breast cancer,"Maryse J. Luijendijk, Sanne M. Buijs, Agnes Jager, Stijn L. W. Koolen, Elsken van der Wall, Sanne B. Schagen, Ron H. J. Mathijssen",2024-11-26,"IntroductionTamoxifen may adversely affect cognitive function by interfering with estrogen action in the brain. Despite growing evidence for a relationship between tamoxifen and cognitive problems, findings remain inconclusive. While some tamoxifen-related side effects seem exposure-dependent with concentrations of tamoxifen or its main metabolite, endoxifen, this has never been investigated for cognitive function. We investigated cognitive function after two years of tamoxifen and its association with tamoxifen and endoxifen exposure.Methods135 women with breast cancer completed the Amsterdam Cognition Scan (ACS), an online neuropsychological test battery, after two years of tamoxifen. Test scores were converted to standardized Z-scores based on a matched ‘no-cancer’ control group. Tamoxifen and endoxifen concentrations and tamoxifen dose were regressed separately on cognitive functioning.ResultsPatients reported mild cognitive complaints and had worse verbal learning, processing speed, executive functioning, and motor functioning compared to matched controls. After correcting for age, mean tamoxifen and endoxifen levels, as well as tamoxifen dose, were associated with worse performance on several cognitive domains.ConclusionTamoxifen is adversely associated with objective as well as self-reported cognitive function, which may depend on the level of exposure to tamoxifen and endoxifen. Further research is warranted to confirm this hypothesis.",
Novel nomogram and risk stratification for peritoneal recurrence after curative resection in gastric cancer,"Yingjiao Zhu, Hao Chen, Yahua Wu, Tao jiang, Xinli Wang, Jianwei Zheng, Xiaoyan Lin",2024-08-17,"Peritoneal recurrence (PR) in gastric cancer after curative resection has poor prognosis. Therefore, we aimed to construct a nomogram to predict PR, and establish PR score for risk stratification to guide adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 315 patients with gastric cancer after radical surgery were included, and randomly stratified into training group (n = 221) and validation group (n = 94). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine predictive factors of PR. The nomogram was constructed to predict the risk of PR. We utilized the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUCs), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to evaluate the performance of the nomogram. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor site, N stage, preoperative CEA, and postoperative CA199 were independent predictors of PR. A nomogram was constructed to predict PR based on these factors. The AUC value was 0.755 in the training group and 0.715 in the validation group. The calibration curves showed good agreement between prediction and observation in the training and validation groups. The decision curve analysis displayed a good net benefit of the nomogram. The novel PR score was developed and patients were stratified into the low-, medium-, and high -risk groups. For the high-risk group, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved patients' overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). The establishment of nomogram facilitates the prediction of PR after radical gastrectomy, and a novel PR score may help guide adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer.","Gastric cancer, Peritoneal recurrence, Nomogram, Risk stratification, Adjuvant chemotherapy"

Brenton",2023-10-24,"High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is a highly heterogeneous disease that typically presents at an advanced, metastatic state. The multi-scale complexity of HGSOC is a major obstacle to predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and understanding critical determinants of response. Here we present a framework to predict the response of HGSOC patients to NACT integrating baseline clinical, blood-based, and radiomic biomarkers extracted from all primary and metastatic lesions. We use an ensemble machine learning model trained to predict the change in total disease volume using data obtained at diagnosis (n = 72). The model is validated in an internal hold-out cohort (n = 20) and an independent external patient cohort (n = 42). In the external cohort the integrated radiomics model reduces the prediction error by 8% with respect to the clinical model, achieving an AUC of 0.78 for RECIST 1.1 classification compared to 0.47 for the clinical model. Our results emphasize the value of including radiomics data in integrative models of treatment response and provide methods for developing new biomarker-based clinical trials of NACT in HGSOC.",
Biomineralized apoferritin nanoparticles delivering dihydroartemisinin and calcium for synergistic breast cancer therapy,"Shanshan Zhao, Peng Liu, Yan Li",2024-11-26,"Breast cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies and poses a severe health risk to women. In recent years, ferroptosis therapy has been considered a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer by promoting intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation (LPO) accumulation. However, insufficient intracellular ROS levels and suboptimal drug accumulation within breast cancer lesions hinder the efficacy of ferroptosis as a single oncological treatment modality. In this study, we developed a self-targeting biomineralized apoferritin-based nanovector, encapsulating the ferroptosis inducer dihydroartemisinin (DHA), to create a synergistic antitumor nano-platform (Ca/DHA@AFn) capable of achieving dual-mode calcicoptosis and ferroptosis therapy. The Ca/DHA@AFn nanoparticles exhibited uniform distribution, with an average particle size of approximately 20 nm and a drug loading efficiency of 2.32%. MTT assay results demonstrated that Ca/DHA@AFn significantly decreased the viability of 4T1 cells compared to the controls (DHA, Ca@AFn, and DHA@AFn), indicating enhanced therapeutic efficacy. In vivo experiments in mice revealed that Ca/DHA@AFn nanoparticles, through combined calcicoptosis/ferroptosis induction, exhibited superior synergistic antitumor effects compared to single-modality treatments, significantly extending survival and demonstrating high biocompatibility. This study introduces a novel and safe biomineralized apoferritin-based nano-platform leveraging calcicoptosis/ferroptosis dual therapy, showing strong antitumor efficacy against breast cancer cells and presenting a promising strategy for breast cancer treatment.","Nano delivery system, Apoferritin, Dihydroartemisinin, Calcicoptosis, Ferroptosis"

However, variable tumour uptake and incomplete clearance of fluorescent dyes reduces the accuracy of distinguishing tumour from normal tissue via conventional fluorescence intensity-based imaging. Here we show that, after systemic injection of the near-infrared dye indocyanine green in patients with various types of solid tumour, the fluorescence lifetime (FLT) of tumour tissue is longer than the FLT of non-cancerous tissue. This tumour-specific shift in FLT can be used to distinguish tumours from normal tissue with an accuracy of over 97% across tumour types, and can be visualized at the cellular level using microscopy and in larger specimens through wide-field imaging. Unlike fluorescence intensity, which depends on imaging-system parameters, tissue depth and the amount of dye taken up by tumours, FLT is a photophysical property that is largely independent of these factors. FLT imaging with indocyanine green may improve the accuracy of cancer surgeries.",
Risk prediction of multiple-station N2 metastasis in patients with upfront surgery for clinical single-station N2 non-small cell lung cancer,"Joon Young Kim, Han Pil Lee, Jae Kwang Yun, Geun Dong Lee, Sehoon Choi, Hyeong Ryul Kim, Yong–Hee Kim, Dong Kwan Kim, Seung–Il Park",2024-08-13,"To investigate long-term outcomes and develop a risk model for pathological multi–station N2 (pN2b) in patients who underwent upfront surgery for clinical single–station N2 (cN2a) non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). From 2006 to 2018, 547 patients who had upfront surgery for suspected cN2a NSCLC underwent analysis. A risk model for predicting pN2b metastasis was developed using preoperative clinical variables via multivariable logistic analysis. Among 547 clinical cN2a NSCLC patients, 118 (21.6%), 58 (10.6%), and 371 (67.8%) had pN0, pN1, and pN2. Among 371 pN2 NSCLC patients, 77 (20.8%), 165 (44.5%), and 129 (34.7%) had pN2a1, pN2a2, and pN2b. The 5-year overall survival rates for pN2a1 and pN2a2 were significantly higher than for pN2b (p = 0.041). Histologic type (p < 0.001), age ≤ 50 years (p < 0.001), preoperatively confirmed N2 metastasis (p < 0.001), and clinical stage IIIB (vs. IIIA) (p = 0.003) were independent risk factors for pN2b metastasis. The risk scoring system based on this model demonstrated good discriminant ability for pN2b disease (area under receiver operating characteristic: 0.779). In cN2a NSCLC patients, those with multiple N2 metastases indicate worse prognosis than those with a single N2 metastasis. Our risk scoring system effectively predicts pN2b in these patients.","NSCLC, Single-station N2, Multi-station N2, Prognosis, Risk score"

To achieve better functional and aesthetic results, we used a Z-shaped incision and compared the functional and aesthetic outcomes of the straight and Z-shaped incisions. Sixty patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomly divided into two groups and underwent lip-splitting between March 2021 and September 2023. Eventually, 77 patients were reviewed within 6 months and evaluated using the lip function assessment scale, patient and observer scar assessment scale, naïve observer scar assessment scale, and a clinical examination. The Z-shaped incision group performed better in terms of the lip pout movement at 3 months and in the subjective overall opinion, color, irregularity, and pigmentation at 6 months. The Z-shaped incision group had a lower incidence of notched vermilion.

We identify eight proteins associated with tumor malignancy in the tissue specimens, which are further validated as potential circulating biomarkers in plasma. Targeted proteomics assays are developed for 12 tissue proteins and 7 blood proteins, and machine learning models are constructed to predict one-year recurrence, which are validated in an independent cohort. These findings contribute to the understanding of EOC pathogenesis and provide potential biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of the disease.

Multimodal MRI-based deep-radiomics model predicts response in cervical cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy,"Zhihua Cai, Sang Li, Zhuang Xiong, Jie Lin, Yang Sun",2024-08-17,"Platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by radical hysterectomy has been proposed as an alternative treatment approach for cervical cancer (CC) in stage Ib2-IIb, who had a strong desire to be treated with surgery. Our study aims to develop a model based on multimodal MRI by using radiomics and deep learning to predict the treatment response in CC patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT). From August 2009 to June 2013, CC patients in stage Ib2-IIb (FIGO 2008) who received NACRT at Fujian Cancer Hospital were enrolled in our study. Clinical information, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI), and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) data were respectively collected. Radiomic features and deep abstract features were extracted from the images using radiomics and deep learning models, respectively. Then, ElasticNet and SVM-RFE were employed for feature selection to construct four single-sequence feature sets. Early fusion of two multi-sequence feature sets and one hybrid feature set were performed, followed by classification prediction using four machine learning classifiers. Subsequently, the performance of the models in predicting the response to NACRT was evaluated by separating patients into training and validation sets. Additionally, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Among the four machine learning models, SVM exhibited the best predictive performance (AUC=0.86). Among the seven feature sets, the hybrid feature set achieved the highest values for AUC (0.86), ACC (0.75), Recall (0.75), Precision (0.81), and F1-score (0.75) in the validation set, outperforming other feature sets. Furthermore, the predicted outcomes of the model were closely associated with patient OS and DFS (p = 0.0044; p = 0.0039). A model based on MRI images with features from multiple sequences and different methods could precisely predict the response to NACRT in CC patients. This model could assist clinicians in devising personalized treatment plans and predicting patient survival outcomes.",

The interventions were: (1) 02/2020: dissemination of febrile neutropenia clinical pathways, (2) April 2021: provision of the clinical pathways via a customized App (Firstline.org) and implementation of a twice-a-week prospective audit and feedback. The main outcome was antibiotic consumption measured by days of administered therapy (DOTs)/1000 patients’ days for all antibiotics and most used molecules. Results: The first intervention (clinical pathways) resulted in a decrease in the overall antibiotic use by the haemato-oncology unit, with an abrupt reduction of 3-gen cephalosporins in favor of piperacillin-tazobactam, as indicated by the clinical pathways. Meropenem and glycopeptide use did not vary. The second intervention (antimicrobial stewardship) further decreased total antibiotic consumption, and a significant decline in meropenem, amikacin, and glycopeptides was achieved.

Here, using primary care electronic health records from Catalonia, Spain (SIDIAP), we built two large cohorts of vaccinated and matched control cancer patients with a primary vaccination scheme (n = 184,744) and a booster (n = 108,534). Most patients received a mRNA-based product in primary (76.2%) and booster vaccination (99.9%). Patients had 51.8% (95% CI 40.3%−61.1%) and 58.4% (95% CI 29.3%−75.5%) protection against COVID-19 hospitalization and COVID-19 death respectively after full vaccination (two-doses) and 77.9% (95% CI 69.2%−84.2%) and 80.2% (95% CI 63.0%−89.4%) after booster. Compared to primary vaccination, the booster dose provided higher peak protection during follow-up. Calibration of VE estimates with negative outcomes, and sensitivity analyses with slight different population and COVID-19 outcomes definitions provided similar results. Our results confirm the role of primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination in preventing COVID-19 severe events in patients with cancer and highlight the need for the additional dose in this population.",

Using RNA-seq data from pre-treatment bone marrows of 1489 children with pAML, we show that > 20% of patients have concurrent IL-6, IL-1, IFNα/β, and TNFα signaling activity and poorer outcomes. Targeted sequencing of pre-treatment bone marrow samples from affected patients (n = 181) revealed 5 highly recurrent patterns of somatic mutation. Using differential expression analyses of the most common genomic subtypes (~60% of total), we identify high expression of multiple potential drivers of inflammation-related treatment resistance. Regardless of genomic subtype, we show that JAK1/2 inhibition reduces receptor-mediated inflammatory signaling by leukemic cells in-vitro. The large number of high-risk pAML genomic subtypes presents an obstacle to the development of mutation-specific therapies. Our findings suggest that therapies targeting inflammatory signaling may be effective across multiple genomic subtypes of pAML.",

Overall, we find a heterogeneous mixture of basal and classical cancer cell subtypes, along with distinct cancer-associated fibroblast and macrophage subpopulations. Strikingly, classical and basal-like cancer cells exhibit similar transcriptional responses to chemotherapy and do not demonstrate a shift towards a basal-like transcriptional program among treated samples. We observe decreased ligand-receptor interactions in treated samples, particularly between TIGIT on CD8 + T cells and its receptor on cancer cells, and identify TIGIT as the major inhibitory checkpoint molecule of CD8 + T cells. Our results suggest that chemotherapy profoundly impacts the PDAC TME and may promote resistance to immunotherapy.",

We identify near-ubiquitous early loss of heterozygosity of TP53, with gain of the mutant allele. This occurs earlier in these tumors compared to tumors with somatic TP53 mutations, suggesting the timing of this mark may distinguish germline from somatic TP53 mutations.

Inflammation promotes resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in high microsatellite instability colorectal cancer,"Qiaoqi Sui, Xi Zhang, Chao Chen, Jinghua Tang, Jiehai Yu, Weihao Li, Kai Han, Wu Jiang, Leen Liao, Lingheng Kong, Yuan Li, Zhenlin Hou, Chi Zhou, Chenzhi Zhang, Linjie Zhang, Binyi Xiao, Weijian Mei, Yanbo Xu, Jiayi Qin, Jian Zheng, Zhizhong Pan, Pei-Rong Ding",2022-11-28,"Inflammation is a common medical complication in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, which plays significant roles in tumor progression and immunosuppression. However, the influence of inflammatory conditions on the tumor response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is incompletely understood. Here we show that in a patient with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) CRC and a local inflammatory condition, the primary tumor progresses but its liver metastasis regresses upon Pembrolizumab treatment. In silico investigation prompted by this observation confirms correlation between inflammatory conditions and poor tumor response to PD-1 blockade in MSI-H CRCs, which is further validated in a cohort of 62 patients retrospectively enrolled to our study. Inhibition of local but not systemic immune response is verified in cultures of paired T cells and organoid cells from patients. Single-cell RNA sequencing suggests involvement of neutrophil leukocytes via CD80/CD86-CTLA4 signaling in the suppressive immune microenvironment. In concordance with this finding, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio indicates inhibited immune status and poor tumor response to ICIs. Receiver operating characteristic curve further demonstrates that both inflammatory conditions and a high NLR could predict a poor response to ICIs in MSI- CRCs, and the predictive value could be further increased when these two predictors are combined. Our study thus suggests that inflammatory conditions in MSI-H CRCs correlate with resistance to ICIs through neutrophil leukocyte associated immunosuppression and proposes both inflammatory conditions and high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as clinical features for poor ICI response.",
PJA1-mediated suppression of pyroptosis as a driver of docetaxel resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"Sheng-Yan Huang, Sha Gong, Yin Zhao, Ming-Liang Ye, Jun-Yan Li, Qing-Mei He, Han Qiao, Xi-Rong Tan, Jing-Yun Wang, Ye-Lin Liang, Sai-Wei Huang, Shi-Wei He, Ying-Qin Li, Sha Xu, Ying-Qing Li, Na Liu",2024-06-21,"Chemoresistance is a main reason for treatment failure in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but the exact regulatory mechanism underlying chemoresistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify PJA1 as a key E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in nasopharyngeal carcinoma chemoresistance that is highly expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with nonresponse to docetaxel-cisplatin-5-fluorouracil induction chemotherapy. We find that PJA1 facilitates docetaxel resistance by inhibiting GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Mechanistically, PJA1 promotes the degradation of the mitochondrial protein PGAM5 by increasing its K48-linked ubiquitination at K88, which further facilitates DRP1 phosphorylation at S637 and reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, resulting in suppression of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis and the antitumour immune response. PGAM5 knockdown fully restores the docetaxel sensitization effect of PJA1 knockdown. Moreover, pharmacological targeting of PJA1 with the small molecule inhibitor RTA402 enhances the docetaxel sensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, high PJA1 expression indicates inferior survival and poor clinical efficacy of TPF IC in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Our study emphasizes the essential role of E3 ligases in regulating chemoresistance and provides therapeutic strategies for nasopharyngeal carcinoma based on targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system.",

Janssen, Anders Blilie, ISUP Prostate Imagebase Expert Panel, Lars Egevad, Ola Spjuth, Martin Eklund",2022-12-15,"Unreliable predictions can occur when an artificial intelligence (AI) system is presented with data it has not been exposed to during training. We demonstrate the use of conformal prediction to detect unreliable predictions, using histopathological diagnosis and grading of prostate biopsies as example. We digitized 7788 prostate biopsies from 1192 men in the STHLM3 diagnostic study, used for training, and 3059 biopsies from 676 men used for testing. With conformal prediction, 1 in 794 (0.1%) predictions is incorrect for cancer diagnosis (compared to 14 errors [2%] without conformal prediction) while 175 (22%) of the predictions are flagged as unreliable when the AI-system is presented with new data from the same lab and scanner that it was trained on. Conformal prediction could with small samples (N = 49 for external scanner, N = 10 for external lab and scanner, and N = 12 for external lab, scanner and pathology assessment) detect systematic differences in external data leading to worse predictive performance. The AI-system with conformal prediction commits 3 (2%) errors for cancer detection in cases of atypical prostate tissue compared to 44 (25%) without conformal prediction, while the system flags 143 (80%) unreliable predictions. We conclude that conformal prediction can increase patient safety of AI-systems.",
Coadaptation fostered by the SLIT2-ROBO1 axis facilitates liver metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"Qing Li, Xiao-Xin Zhang, Li-Peng Hu, Bo Ni, Dong-Xue Li, Xu Wang, Shu-Heng Jiang, Hui Li, Min-Wei Yang, Yong-Sheng Jiang, Chun-Jie Xu, Xue-Li Zhang, Yan-Li Zhang, Pei-Qi Huang, Qin Yang, Yang Zhou, Jian-ren Gu, Gary Gui-Shan Xiao, Yong-wei Sun, Jun Li, Zhi-Gang Zhang",2023-02-15,"To explore the mechanism of coadaptation and the potential drivers of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) metastasis to the liver, we study key molecules involved in this process and their translational value. Premetastatic niche (PMN) and macrometastatic niche (MMN) formation in a mouse model is observed via CT combined with 3D organ reconstruction bioluminescence imaging, and then we screen slit guidance ligand 2 (SLIT2) and its receptor roundabout guidance receptor 1 (ROBO1) as important factors. After we confirm the expression and distribution of SLIT2 and ROBO1 in samples from PDAC patients and several mouse models, we discover that SLIT2-ROBO1-mediated coadaptation facilitated the implantation and outgrowth of PDAC disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) in the liver. We also demonstrate the dependence receptor (DR) characteristics of ROBO1 in a follow-up mechanistic study. A neutralizing antibody targeting ROBO1 significantly attenuate liver metastasis of PDAC by preventing the coadaptation effect. Thus, we demonstrate that coadaptation is supported by the DR characteristics in the PMN and MMN.",
"Neoadjuvant therapy with immune checkpoint blockade, antiangiogenesis, and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer","Song Li, Wenbin Yu, Fei Xie, Haitao Luo, Zhimin Liu, Weiwei Lv, Duanbo Shi, Dexin Yu, Peng Gao, Cheng Chen, Meng Wei, Wenhao Zhou, Jiaqian Wang, Zhikun Zhao, Xin Dai, Qian Xu, Xue Zhang, Miao Huang, Kai Huang, Jian Wang, Jisheng Li, Lei Sheng, Lian Liu",2023-01-03,"Despite neoadjuvant/conversion chemotherapy, the prognosis of cT4a/bN+ gastric cancer is poor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic agents have shown activity in late-stage gastric cancer, but their efficacy in the neoadjuvant/conversion setting is unclear. In this single-armed, phase II, exploratory trial (NCT03878472), we evaluate the efficacy of a combination of ICI (camrelizumab), antiangiogenesis (apatinib), and chemotherapy (S-1 ± oxaliplatin) for neoadjuvant/conversion treatment of cT4a/bN+ gastric cancer. The primary endpoints are pathological responses and their potential biomarkers. Secondary endpoints include safety, objective response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Complete and major pathological response rates are 15.8% and 26.3%. Pathological responses correlate significantly with microsatellite instability status, PD-L1 expression, and tumor mutational burden. In addition, multi-omics examination reveals several putative biomarkers for pathological responses, including RREB1 and SSPO mutation, immune-related signatures, and a peripheral T cell expansion score. Multi-omics also demonstrates dynamic changes in dominant tumor subclones, immune microenvironments, and T cell receptor repertoires during neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The toxicity and post-surgery complications are limited. These data support further validation of ICI- and antiangiogenesis-based neoadjuvant/conversion therapy in large randomized trials and provide candidate biomarkers.",
Niche stiffness sustains cancer stemness via TAZ and NANOG phase separation,"Xinwei Liu, Yingying Ye, Liling Zhu, Xiaoyun Xiao, Boxuan Zhou, Yuanting Gu, Hang Si, Huixin Liang, Mingzhu Liu, Jiaqian Li, Qiongchao Jiang, Jiang Li, Shubin Yu, Ruiying Ma, Shicheng Su, Jian-You Liao, Qiyi Zhao",2023-01-16,"Emerging evidence shows that the biomechanical environment is required to support cancer stem cells (CSCs), which play a crucial role in drug resistance. However, how mechanotransduction signals regulate CSCs and its clinical significance has remained unclear. Using clinical-practice ultrasound elastography for patients’ lesions and atomic force microscopy for surgical samples, we reveal that increased matrix stiffness is associated with poor responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, worse prognosis, and CSC enrichment in patients with breast cancer. Mechanically, TAZ activated by biomechanics enhances CSC properties via phase separation with NANOG. TAZ-NANOG phase separation, which is dependent on acidic residues in the N-terminal activation domain of NANOG, promotes the transcription of SOX2 and OCT4. Therapeutically, targeting NANOG or TAZ reduces CSCs and enhances the chemosensitivity in vivo. Collectively, this study demonstrated that the phase separation of a pluripotency transcription factor links mechanical cues in the niche to the fate of CSCs.",

Here, we conduct integrated whole exome and RNA sequencing analysis in 115 DDLPS tumors and perform comparative genomic analysis of well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components from eight DDLPS samples. Several somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs), including the gain of 12q15, are identified as frequent genomic alterations. CTDSP1/2-DNM3OS fusion genes are identified in a subset of DDLPS tumors. Based on the association of SCNAs with clinical features, the DDLPS tumors are clustered into three groups. This clustering can predict the clinical outcome independently. The comparative analysis between well-differentiated and dedifferentiated components identify two categories of genomic alterations: shared alterations, associated with tumorigenesis, and dedifferentiated-specific alterations, associated with malignant transformation. This large-scale genomic analysis reveals the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of DDLPS and provides insights that could contribute to the refinement of DDLPS management.",
Impact of Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction on quantitative and qualitative aspects for pulmonary nodule detection in digital 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT,"Niklas Lohaus, Florian Enderlin, Stephan Skawran, Alexander Maurer, Ahmad M. A. Abukwaik, Daniel Franzen, Martin W. Huellner, Michael Messerli",2022-05-18,"To evaluate the impact of block sequential regularized expectation maximization (BSREM) reconstruction on quantitative and qualitative aspects of 2-[18F]FDG-avid pulmonary nodules compared to conventional ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction method. Ninety-one patients with 144 2-[18F]FDG-avid pulmonary nodules (all ≤ 20 mm) undergoing PET/CT for oncological (re-)staging were retrospectively included. Quantitative parameters in BSREM and OSEM (including point spread function modelling) were measured, including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). Nodule conspicuity in BSREM and OSEM images was evaluated by two readers. Wilcoxon matched pairs signed-rank test was used to compare quantitative and qualitative parameters in BSREM and OSEM. Pulmonary nodule SUVmax was significantly higher in BSREM images compared to OSEM images [BSREM 5.4 (1.2–20.7), OSEM 3.6 (0.7–17.4); p = 0.0001]. In a size-based analysis, the relative increase in SUVmax was more pronounced in smaller nodules (≤ 7 mm) as compared to larger nodules (8–10 mm, or > 10 mm). Lesion conspicuity was higher in BSREM than in OSEM (p < 0.0001). BSREM reconstruction results in a significant increase in SUVmax and a significantly improved conspicuity of small 2-[18F]FDG-avid pulmonary nodules compared to OSEM reconstruction. Digital 2-[18F]FDG-PET/CT reading may be enhanced with BSREM as small lesion conspicuity is improved.",
Distinct clinicopathological and genomic features in solid and basaloid adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast,"Juan Ji, Fang Zhang, Fanglei Duan, Hong Yang, Jun Hou, Yang Liu, Jie Dai, Qiong Liao, Xian Chen, Qingsong Liu",2022-05-19,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) of the breast is a rare indolent carcinoma of salivary gland-type tumors, frequently associated with MYB genetic alteration. Solid and basaloid adenoid cystic carcinoma (SB-AdCC) is considered a sparse variant of AdCC. This study sought to search for clinicopathological and genomic features in SB-AdCC. Registered clinicopathological data on a cohort of 13 AdCC of the breast cases, including six conventional adenoid cystic carcinoma (C-AdCC) cases and seven SB-AdCC cases, were collected. MYB gene rearrangement via fluorescent in situ hybridization was investigated and MYB protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Compared with C-AdCC, we found that the distribution of SB-AdCC cases were shifted to older age and were more frequently distant metastasis. Moreover, metastasis cases also showed a high (exceed 30%) Ki-67 index. Both groups showed MYB rearrangements and MYB protein expression, but they were less frequent in SB-AdCC than C-AdCC. To conclude, our results suggest that SB-AdCC is an aggressive variant of mammary AdCC with a higher incidence of distant metastases compared with C-AdCC, though they share common molecular features. A high Ki-67 index may be an adverse prognostic factor for metastasis.",
"Trends in female breast cancer incidence, mortality, and survival in Austria, with focus on age, stage, and birth cohorts (1983–2017)","Lazo Ilic, Gerald Haidinger, Judit Simon, Monika Hackl, Eva Schernhammer, Kyriaki Papantoniou",2022-04-29,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed malignant disease and the leading cause of cancer death in women in Austria. We investigated overall and subgroup-specific female breast cancer rates to provide a comprehensive analysis of trends over several decades. Incidence, mortality, and survival, as well as age-, stage-, and birth cohort-specific incidence were analysed using nationwide cancer registry data on 163,694 cases of female breast cancer in Austria (1983–2017). Annual percentage changes were estimated using joinpoint regression. BC incidence underwent linear increases until 1997 and reversed with statistically non-significant declines until 2017. After initial increases in BC-specific mortality, rates were stable from 1989 through 1995 and started declining thereafter, although statistically non-significantly after 2011. Overall BC-specific survivals, as well as survivals according to the calendar period of diagnosis, increased throughout the observation period. Incidence in younger women (aged 44 and lower) showed linear increases, whereas for women aged 45 and higher mostly stable or decreasing rates were observed. Localised BC incidence increased markedly and started declining only in 2012. Distant disease-BC incidence decreased through the whole observation period and incidence of regionalised BC started declining in 2000. Birth cohort-specific incidence peaked in women born between 1935 and 1949 (ages 45–74). In conclusion, the incidence of BC in younger women is increasing, while overall female BC incidence and mortality are stable with non-significant declines. Further, increases in the incidence of early-stage BC (localised) seem disproportionately high in comparison to more modest decreases in late-stage BC incidence (regionalised and distant disease).",
Overcoming primary and acquired resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy by induction and activation of tumor-residing cDC1s,"Takaaki Oba, Mark D. Long, Tibor Keler, Henry C. Marsh, Hans Minderman, Scott I. Abrams, Song Liu, Fumito Ito",2020-10-27,"The ability of cancer cells to ensure T-cell exclusion from the tumor microenvironment is a significant mechanism of resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Evidence indicates crucial roles of Batf3-dependent conventional type-1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) for inducing antitumor T-cell immunity; however, strategies to maximize cDC1 engagement remain elusive. Here, using multiple orthotopic tumor mouse models resistant to anti-PD-L1-therapy, we are testing the hypothesis that in situ induction and activation of tumor-residing cDC1s overcomes poor T-cell infiltration. In situ immunomodulation with Flt3L, radiotherapy, and TLR3/CD40 stimulation induces an influx of stem-like Tcf1+ Slamf6+ CD8+ T cells, triggers regression not only of primary, but also untreated distant tumors, and renders tumors responsive to anti-PD-L1 therapy. Furthermore, serial in situ immunomodulation (ISIM) reshapes repertoires of intratumoral T cells, overcomes acquired resistance to anti-PD-L1 therapy, and establishes tumor-specific immunological memory. These findings provide new insights into cDC1 biology as a critical determinant to overcome mechanisms of intratumoral T-cell exclusion.",

Presence of leptomeningeal metastases is indicative of poor prognosis. Here we report that inactivation of Rb plus p53 via a WAP-Cre transgene, commonly used to target the mammary gland during pregnancy, induces metastatic pineoblastoma resembling the human disease with 100% penetrance. A stabilizing mutation rather than deletion of p53 accelerates metastatic dissemination. Deletion of Dicer1 plus p53 via WAP-Cre also predisposes to pineoblastoma, albeit with lower penetrance. In silico analysis predicts tricyclic antidepressants such as nortriptyline as potential therapeutics for both pineoblastoma models. Nortriptyline disrupts the lysosome, leading to accumulation of non-functional autophagosome, cathepsin B release and pineoblastoma cell death. Nortriptyline further synergizes with the antineoplastic drug gemcitabine to effectively suppress pineoblastoma in our preclinical models, offering new modality for this lethal childhood malignancy.",

To characterize the intra-patient evolutionary relationships of metastases that evade treatment, we perform genome-wide copy number profiling and bespoke approaches targeting the androgen receptor (AR) on 167 metastatic regions from 11 organs harvested post-mortem from 10 men who died from prostate cancer. We identify diverse and patient-unique alterations clustering around the AR in metastases from every patient with evidence of independent acquisition of related genomic changes within an individual and, in some patients, the co-existence of AR-neutral clones. Using the genomic boundaries of pan-autosome copy number changes, we confirm a common clone of origin across metastases and diagnostic biopsies, and identified in individual patients, clusters of metastases occupied by dominant clones with diverged autosomal copy number alterations. These autosome-defined clusters are characterized by cluster-specific AR gene architectures, and in two index cases are topologically more congruent than by chance (p-values 3.07 × 10−8 and 6.4 × 10−4). Integration with anatomical sites suggests patterns of spread and points of genomic divergence. Here, we show that copy number boundaries identify treatment-selected clones with putatively distinct lethal trajectories.",
Desmoplastic stroma restricts T cell extravasation and mediates immune exclusion and immunosuppression in solid tumors,"Zebin Xiao, Leslie Todd, Li Huang, Estela Noguera-Ortega, Zhen Lu, Lili Huang, Meghan Kopp, Yue Li, Nimisha Pattada, Wenqun Zhong, Wei Guo, John Scholler, Maria Liousia, Charles-Antoine Assenmacher, Carl H. June, Steven M. Albelda, Ellen Puré",2023-08-22,"The desmoplastic stroma in solid tumors presents a formidable challenge to immunotherapies that rely on endogenous or adoptively transferred T cells, however, the mechanisms are poorly understood. To define mechanisms involved, here we treat established desmoplastic pancreatic tumors with CAR T cells directed to fibroblast activation protein (FAP), an enzyme highly overexpressed on a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Depletion of FAP+ CAFs results in loss of the structural integrity of desmoplastic matrix. This renders these highly treatment-resistant cancers susceptible to subsequent treatment with a tumor antigen (mesothelin)-targeted CAR T cells and to anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. Mechanisms include overcoming stroma-dependent restriction of T cell extravasation and/or perivascular invasion, reversing immune exclusion, relieving T cell suppression, and altering the immune landscape by reducing myeloid cell accumulation and increasing endogenous CD8+ T cell and NK cell infiltration. These data provide strong rationale for combining tumor stroma- and malignant cell-targeted therapies to be tested in clinical trials.",

Previously, our study group reported that patients experienced abdominal pain for several weeks after PIPAC-OX. However, it is unknown how this compares to abdominal pain after regular colorectal cancer surgery. To provide some perspective, this study compared the presence of abdominal pain after PIPAC-OX to the presence of abdominal pain after primary tumor surgery. Patient reported abdominal pain scores (EORTC QLQ-CR-29), from two prospective, Dutch cohorts were used in this study. Scores ranged from 0 to 100, a higher score represents more abdominal pain. Abdominal pain at baseline and at four weeks after treatment were compared between the two groups. Twenty patients who underwent PIPAC-OX and 322 patients who underwent primary tumor surgery were included in the analysis. At baseline, there were no differences in abdominal pain between both groups (mean 20 vs. 18, respectively; p = 0.688). Four weeks after treatment, abdominal pain was significantly worse in the PIPAC group (39 vs 15, respectively; p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = 0.99). The differential effect over time for abdominal pain differed significantly between both groups (mean difference: 19 vs − 3, respectively; p = 0.004; Cohen’s d = 0.88). PIPAC-OX resulted in significantly worse postoperative abdominal pain than primary tumor surgery. These results can be used for patient counseling and stress the need for adequate analgesia during and after PIPAC-OX. Further research is required to prevent or reduce abdominal pain after PIPAC-OX.Trial registration CRC-PIPAC: Clinicaltrails.gov NCT03246321 (01-10-2017)",

The infiltration of cytotoxic T cells in tumor microenvironment(TME) were assessed by immunofluorescence staining. The levels of pro-inflammatory chemokines were analyzed by ELISA. The protein interaction was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down. The genomic instability was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy.ResultsSKP2 inhibition significantly improved the antitumor efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Furthermore, SKP2 inhibition activated the cGAS/STING signal pathway and induced the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines, thereby promoting cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Additionally, we identified CDC6, a DNA replication licensing factor as a novel substrate of SKP2 in addition to CDT1. SKP2 induced protein degradation of CDC6 and CDT1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Conversely, SKP2 inhibition elevated CDC6 and CDT1 protein levels, which caused DNA aberrant replication, DNA damage and genomic instability, thereby resulting in the accumulation of cytosolic DNA, activating cGAS/STING signaling pathway and improving antitumor immunity.ConclusionSKP2 may be used as an effective therapeutic target to enable ICB antitumor immunotherapy.Social mediaPeng et al. found that SKP2 inhibition improved the antitumor immunotherapy by activating tumor cell-intrinsic immunity, thereby providing evidences that SKP2 may be used as an effective therapeutic target to enable ICB antitumor immunotherapy.",

DLR T2WI achieved a 69% reduction in scan time relative to TSE T2WI. The intermethod agreement between the two T2WI sets in terms of the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) classification and extraprostatic extension (EPE) grade was measured using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and diagnostic performance was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Clinically significant PCa (csPCa) was found in 74 (45.7%) patients. Both T2WI methods showed high intermethod agreement for the overall PI-RADS classification (ICC: 0.907–0.949), EPE assessment (ICC: 0.925–0.957) and lesion size measurement (ICC: 0.980–0.996). DLR T2WI and TSE T2WI showed similar AUCs (0.666–0.814 versus 0.684–0.832) for predicting EPE. The AUCs for detecting csPCa with DLR T2WI (0.834–0.935) and TSE T2WI (0.891–0.935) were comparable in 139 patients with TZ lesions with no significant differences (P > 0.05). The findings suggest that DLR T2WI is an efficient alternative for TZ lesion assessment, offering reduced scan times without compromising diagnostic accuracy.","Deep learning-based reconstruction, Acceleration, Prostate cancer, Magnetic resonance imaging, T2-weighted imaging, Staging"

Although t-MN can occur both in adult and childhood cancer survivors, the mechanisms driving therapy-related leukemogenesis likely vary across different ages. Chemotherapy is thought to induce driver mutations in children, whereas in adults pre-existing mutant clones are selected by the exposure. However, selective pressures induced by chemotherapy early in life are less well studied. Here, we use single-cell whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic inference to show that the founding cell of t-MN in children starts expanding after cessation of platinum exposure. In patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, characterized by a germline TP53 mutation, we find that the t-MN already expands during treatment, suggesting that platinum-induced growth inhibition is TP53-dependent. Our results demonstrate that germline aberrations can interact with treatment exposures in inducing t-MN, which is important for the development of more targeted, patient-specific treatment regimens and follow-up.",
"Depression, performance status, and discontinued treatment mediate an association of curability belief with prognosis in advanced cancer patients","Je-Yeon Yun, Ju Youn Jung, Bhumsuk Keam, Na-Ri Lee, Jung Hun Kang, Yu Jung Kim, Hyun-Jeong Shim, Kyung Hae Jung, Su-Jin Koh, Hyewon Ryu, Shin Hyu Yoo, EunKyo Kang, Young Ho Yun",2024-11-24,"Individuals diagnosed with advanced cancer often experience stress and depression, factors linked to worse survival. Curability belief—defined as the hope and expectation of cure through treatment, based on affective forecasting—may differ from the patient’s actual life expectancy (i.e., likelihood estimation) and has shown variable associations with cancer survival. In this study, multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to examine the effect of curability belief and depression on 1-year survival after adjustment for physical factors. Additionally, regularized partial correlations among physical and psychological factors were assessed using mixed graphical models to elucidate their roles in mediating the relationship between curability belief and 1-year survival. This multi-center cohort study, conducted across 13 tertiary hospitals (including four ranked among the ‘World’s Best Specialized Hospitals 2025’ in oncology), involved 382 adults with stage IV advanced cancer and an oncologist-estimated survival of more than 6 months. Baseline data included demographics, primary tumor site, number of metastatic sites, symptom burdens (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), performance status (ECOG-PS), depression levels (PHQ-9), anti-cancer treatment type, patient’s life expectancy estimation, and curability belief. Follow-up data included 1-year survival and end-of-life care (place of death) for deceased patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for curability belief, depression, and their interaction on 1-year survival, adjusting for significant demographic and clinical factors from univariate Cox regressions. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to plot survival probability by curability belief and depression interaction. Mixed graphical models estimated regularized partial correlations among 1-year survival, curability belief, patient’s life expectancy, depression, primary tumor site, anti-cancer treatment type, performance status, and symptom burden. In terms of healthcare utilization, patients with curability belief were more likely to receive standard or advanced anti-cancer therapy, while those without curability belief tended to suspend or discontinue therapy (P < 0.001). Among patients who did not survive the 1-year follow-up (N = 161), end-of-life care settings differed significantly between those with curability belief (predominantly nursing homes and home settings) and those without (primarily hospice and tertiary/secondary hospitals; P = 0.036). In multivariate Cox regression, curability belief (P = 0.003), depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10; P = 0.003), and their interaction (P = 0.040) were significantly associated with 1-year survival, after adjusting for sex, residential area, primary tumor site, performance status, anti-cancer treatment type, and symptom burdens (fatigue and appetite loss). The relationship between curability belief and 1-year survival was significant only in patients without depression [PHQ-9 score < 10; aHR (95% CI) = 2.20 (1.31–3.70); P = 0.003]. In the mixed graphical model, node predictability values for curability belief, depression, and 1-year survival were 0.68, 0.50, and 0.70, respectively, with curability belief showing partial correlations with depression (r = 0.30) and patients’ life expectancy (r = 0.20); depression correlated with fatigue (r = 0.53), anorexia (r = 0.16), life expectancy (r = 0.24), performance status (r = 0.23), and curability belief; and 1-year survival correlated with suspended/stopped anti-cancer treatment (r = 0.45), primary tumor site (r = 0.24), and performance status (r = 0.15). Partial correlations of performance status with depression and discontinued treatment mediated the association between curability belief and 1-year survival. Curability belief among stage IV advanced cancer patients with an oncologist-estimated survival of over 6 months was associated with depression levels and patients’ perceived life expectancy estimations. Performance status, depression, and anti-cancer treatment status mediate the relationship between curability belief and improved 1-year survival in patients without depression. Further research using longitudinal modeling of depression, performance status, and healthcare utilization, with curability belief and primary tumor site as covariates, is warranted.Trial registration: Clinical Trial Number (ClinicalTrials.gov): NCT03222258; Study Registration Dates (First submitted: 2017-06-05; First submitted following the QC criteria: 2017-07-16; First posted: 2017-07-19).","Advanced cancer, Curability belief, Depression, 1-year survival, Cox proportional hazard regression model, Mixed graphical model"
Prevention of postpancreatectomy hemorrhage after laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy by wrapping ligamentum teres hepatis surrounding hepatic portal artery,"Zhicheng Wang, Yong Wang, Chao Zhu, Hongtao Pan, Shilei Chen, Xiaosi Hu, Shuai Zhou, Huichun Liu, Qing Pang, Hao Jin",2024-08-07,"Postpancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH) is an important risk factor for postoperative complications after laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD). Recent studies have reported that the use of ligamentum teres hepatis (LTH) in LPD may reduce the risk of PPH. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether wrapping the hepatic hilar artery with the LTH can reduce PPH after LPD. We reviewed the data of 131 patients who underwent LPD in our team from April 2018 to December 2023. The patients were divided into Groups A (60 patients) and B (71 patients) according to whether the hepatic portal artery was wrapped or not. The perioperative data of the two groups were compared to evaluate the effect of LTH wrapping the hepatic hilar artery on LPD. The platelet count of Group A was (225.25 ± 87.61) × 10^9/L, and that of Group B was (289.38 ± 127.35) × 10^9/L, with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001). The operation time of group A [300.00 (270.00, 364.00)] minutes was shorter than that of group B [330.00 (300.00, 360.00)] minutes, p = 0.037. In addition, A set of postoperative hospital stay [12.00 (10.00, 15.00)] days shorter than group B [15.00 (12.00, 19.50)] days, p < 0.001. No PPH occurred in Group A, while 8 patients in Group B had PPH (7 cases of gastroduodenal artery hemorrhage and 1 case of proper hepatic artery hemorrhage), p = 0.019. The new technique of wrapping the hepatic hilar artery through the LTH can effectively reduce the occurrence of PPH after LPD.",
Spatial interactions of immune cells as potential predictors to efficacy of toripalimab plus chemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a phase Ib/II trial,"Ke Cheng, Xiaoying Li, Wanrui Lv, Gang Zhao, Ruihan Zhou, Chen Chang, Heqi Yang, Ruizhen Li, Zhiping Li, Ye Chen, Cheng Yi, Ouying Yan, Chaoxin Xiao, Yi Zhang, Junjie Xiong, Zixin Huang, Weikang Shao, Xin You, Wenhao Guo, Du He, Wenwu Ling, Rui Wang, Bole Tian, Chengjian Zhao, Dan Cao",2024-11-25,"Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a dismal prognosis. Immunotherapy alone offers limited efficacy, but it is still unknown whether its combination with chemotherapy could offer synergistic anti-tumor effects. This phase Ib/II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of combining toripalimab with the gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) regimen as first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic PDAC and explored predictive biomarkers (ChiCTR2000032293). The primary endpoints were safety and overall survival (OS). The secondary outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and progression-free survival (PFS). Immune-related biomarkers including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, genetic status, cytokine levels, and spatial features of the tumor immune microenviroment (TIME) were investigated. Neither serious treatment-related adverse events nor grade 4 immune-related adverse events were reported. Among the 72 patients, the median OS was 8.9 months, 12-month OS rate was 31.9%, with median PFS of 5.6 months, ORR of 33.3%, and DCR of 90.3%. Higher PD-L1 expression, without liver metastases were associated with higher ORR, however these factors could not effectively distinguish responders and non-responders. Importantly, dendritic cells - T helper cells - cytotoxic T lymphocytes (DC-Th-CTL) enriched immune niche and their spatial interactions were dominant predictors of response based on TIME analysis using a cyclic multiplex tissue staining assay, with an area under the curve value of 0.8. Overall, GnP plus toripalimab exhibited good safety and differentiated efficacy in selected population, and the spatial interactions of DC-Th-CTL represent promising predictors to efficacy of immunochemotherapy in locally advanced or metastatic PDAC.",
Mendelian randomization analysis reveals causal effects of inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune hyperthyroidism on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma risk,"Chunyi Lyu, Yan Wang, Ruirong Xu",2024-11-25,"The clinical phenomenon whereby diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in patients with a history of autoimmune disease (AD) has been noted, but it remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the causal associations between nine ADs and DLBCL via a Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) obtained from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was chosen as instrumental variable (IV). A total of nine ADs of European ancestry including asthma (56,167 cases and 352,255 controls), psoriasis (4,510 cases and 212,242 controls), autoimmune hyperthyroidism (962 cases and 172,976 controls), inflammatory bowel disease (31,665 cases and 33,977 controls), type 1 diabetes (6,683 cases and 12,173 controls), multiple sclerosis (14,498 cases and 24,091 controls), sarcoidosis (2,046 cases and 215,712 controls), ankylosing spondylitis (9,069 cases and 1,550 controls), and celiac disease (12,041 cases and 12,228 controls), were set as the exposure and DLBCL (209 cases and 218,583 controls) of European ancestry as the outcome. Inverse-variance weighted (IVW) was used as the primary analysis method, and the weighted median and MR-Egger method were used as supplementary methods. The sensitivity analyses employed in this study include the MR-Egger intercept, MR-PRESSO global test, Cochran’s Q test, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plot. IVW showed that inflammatory bowel disease (OR = 1.241, 95% CI 1.009–1.526, P = 0.040) and autoimmune hyperthyroidism (OR = 1.464, 95% CI 1.103–1.942, P = 0.008) increased the risk of DLBCL without significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy, and the results remained stable according to the leave-one-out analysis. The IVW results revealed no associations between the other seven ADs and DLBCL: asthma (OR = 0.782, 95% CI 0.395–1.546, P = 0.159), psoriasis (OR = 0.842, 95% CI 0.669–1.060, P = 0.143), type 1 diabetes (OR = 1.071, 95% CI 0.860–1.334, P = 0.537), multiple sclerosis (OR = 1.331, 95% CI 0.941–1.883, P = 0.105), sarcoidosis (OR = 1.324, 95% CI 0.861–2.038, P = 0.200), ankylosing spondylitis (OR = 1.884, 95% CI 0.776–4.573, P = 0.161), and celiac disease (OR = 1.003, 95% CI 0.854–1.178, P = 0.969). Although no significant heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy was detected in these seven ADs and DLBCL, these results did not pass the leave-one-out analysis; therefore, the results need to be interpreted with caution. Inflammatory bowel disease and autoimmune hyperthyroidism may increase the onset of DLBCL. The risk of DLBCL should be considered in specific types of ADs.","Autoimmune disease, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Mendelian randomization, Inflammatory bowel disease, Autoimmune hyperthyroidism"
Epigenetic and molecular coordination between HDAC2 and SMAD3-SKI regulates essential brain tumour stem cell characteristics,"Ravinder K. Bahia, Xiaoguang Hao, Rozina Hassam, Orsolya Cseh, Danielle A. Bozek, H. Artee Luchman, Samuel Weiss",2023-08-19,"Histone deacetylases are important epigenetic regulators that have been reported to play essential roles in cancer stem cell functions and are promising therapeutic targets in many cancers including glioblastoma. However, the functionally relevant roles of specific histone deacetylases, in the maintenance of key self-renewal and growth characteristics of brain tumour stem cell (BTSC) sub-populations of glioblastoma, remain to be fully resolved. Here, using pharmacological inhibition and genetic loss and gain of function approaches, we identify HDAC2 as the most relevant histone deacetylase for re-organization of chromatin accessibility resulting in maintenance of BTSC growth and self-renewal properties. Furthermore, its specific interaction with the transforming growth factor-β pathway related proteins, SMAD3 and SKI, is crucial for the maintenance of tumorigenic potential in BTSCs in vitro and in orthotopic xenograft models. Inhibition of HDAC2 activity and disruption of the coordinated mechanisms regulated by the HDAC2-SMAD3-SKI axis are thus promising therapeutic approaches for targeting BTSCs.",
Breast cancer clinical trial participation among diverse patients at a comprehensive cancer center,"Emily L. Podany, Shaun Bulsara, Katherine Sanchez, Kristen Otte, Matthew J. Ellis, Maryam Kinik",2024-08-03,"This study was designed to determine the enrollment patterns in breast cancer clinical trials (CCTs) of patients with diverse backgrounds in an equal access setting and to evaluate the factors contributing to low rates of clinical trial accrual in patients of low socioeconomic status (SES). We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of new patients seen at the Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center dating from 5/2015 to 9/2021, which included 3043 patients screened for breast CCTs. We compared the rate of CCT availability, eligibility, and enrollment between two patient populations: Smith Clinic, where most patients are of low SES and uninsured, and Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center (BSLMC) with mostly predominantly insured, higher income patients. We performed logistic regression to evaluate whether differences in age, clinic, race, trial type, and primary language may be underlying the differences in CCT enrollment. More patients were eligible for CCTs at Smith Clinic (53.7% vs 44.7%, p < 0.001). However, Smith Clinic patients were more likely to decline CCT enrollment compared to BSLMC (61.3% declined vs 39.4%, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, Black patients had a significantly higher rate of CCT refusal overall (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.12–0.56, p < 0.001) and BSLMC only (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.060–0.60, p = 0.006). Our data shows that it is likely an oversimplification to assume that equal access will lead to the elimination of CCT disparities. Efforts to diversify CCTs must include consideration of structural and institutional inequities as well as social needs.",
Machine learning evaluation of intensified conditioning on haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients,"Tomoyasu Jo, Kosuke Inoue, Tomoaki Ueda, Makoto Iwasaki, Yu Akahoshi, Satoshi Nishiwaki, Hiroki Hatsusawa, Tetsuya Nishida, Naoyuki Uchida, Ayumu Ito, Masatsugu Tanaka, Satoru Takada, Toshiro Kawakita, Shuichi Ota, Yuta Katayama, Satoshi Takahashi, Makoto Onizuka, Yuta Hasegawa, Keisuke Kataoka, Yoshinobu Kanda, Takahiro Fukuda, Ken Tabuchi, Yoshiko Atsuta, Yasuyuki Arai",2024-11-25,"BackgroundThe advantage of intensified myeloablative conditioning (MAC) over standard MAC has not been determined in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients.MethodsTo evaluate heterogeneous effects of intensified MAC among individuals, we analyzed the registry database of adult ALL patients between 2000 and 2021. After propensity score matching, we applied a machine-learning Bayesian causal forest algorithm to develop a prediction model of individualized treatment effect (ITE) of intensified MAC on reduction in overall mortality at 1 year after HSCT.ResultsAmong 2440 propensity score-matched patients, our model shows heterogeneity in the association between intensified MAC and 1-year overall mortality. Individuals in the high-benefit group (n = 1220), defined as those with ITEs greater than the median, are more likely to be younger, male, and to have higher refined Disease Risk Index (rDRI), T-cell phenotype, and grafts from related donors than those in the low-benefit group (n = 1220). The high-benefit approach (applying intensified MAC to individuals in the high-benefit group) shows the largest reduction in overall mortality at 1 year (risk difference [95% confidence interval], +5.94 percentage points [0.88 to 10.51], p = 0.011). In contrast, the high-risk approach (targeting patients with high or very high rDRI) does not achieve statistical significance (risk difference [95% confidence interval], +3.85 percentage points [−1.11 to 7.90], p = 0.063).ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the high-benefit approach, targeting patients expected to benefit from intensified MAC, has the capacity to maximize HSCT effectiveness using intensified MAC.",

Sorger, Mehdi Touat, Sandro Santagata",2022-08-16,"How the glioma immune microenvironment fosters tumorigenesis remains incompletely defined. Here, we use single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplexed tissue-imaging to characterize the composition, spatial organization, and clinical significance of extracellular purinergic signaling in glioma. We show that microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while tumor cells principally express CD73. In glioblastoma, CD73 is associated with EGFR amplification, astrocyte-like differentiation, and increased adenosine, and is linked to hypoxia. Glioblastomas enriched for CD73 exhibit inflammatory microenvironments, suggesting that purinergic signaling regulates immune adaptation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate a strong spatial correlation between tumor-CD73 and microglial-CD39, with proximity associated with poor outcomes. Similar spatial organization is present in pediatric high-grade gliomas including H3K27M-mutant diffuse midline glioma. These data reveal that purinergic signaling in gliomas is shaped by genotype, lineage, and functional state, and that core enzymes expressed by tumor and myeloid cells are organized to promote adenosine-rich microenvironments potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting.",
DNA methylation-based epigenetic signatures predict somatic genomic alterations in gliomas,"Jie Yang, Qianghu Wang, Ze-Yan Zhang, Lihong Long, Ravesanker Ezhilarasan, Jerome M.

Sulman",2022-07-29,"Molecular classification has improved diagnosis and treatment for patients with malignant gliomas. However, classification has relied on individual assays that are both costly and slow, leading to frequent delays in treatment. Here, we propose the use of DNA methylation, as an emerging clinical diagnostic platform, to classify gliomas based on major genomic alterations and provide insight into subtype characteristics. We show that using machine learning models, DNA methylation signatures can accurately predict somatic alterations and show improvement over existing classifiers. The established Unified Diagnostic Pipeline (UniD) we develop is rapid and cost-effective for genomic alterations and gene expression subtypes diagnostic at early clinical phase and improves over individual assays currently in clinical use. The significant relationship between genetic alteration and epigenetic signature indicates broad applicability of our approach to other malignancies.",

Here, we leverage sequencing data from the PanGen trial to perform comprehensive characterization of the molecular landscape of KRAS wildtype mPDAC and reveal increased frequency of chr1q amplification encompassing transcription factors PROX1 and NR5A2. By leveraging data from colorectal adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma samples, we highlight similarities between cholangiocarcinoma and KRAS wildtype mPDAC involving both mutation and expression-based signatures and validate these findings using an independent dataset. These data further establish KRAS wildtype mPDAC as a unique molecular entity, with therapeutic opportunities extending beyond gene fusion events.",

To uncover the molecular heterogeneity of this disease, we perform RNA sequencing, methylation array analysis, whole exome and targeted deep sequencing on 84 infants with KMT2A-rearranged leukemia. Our multi-omics clustering followed by single-sample and single-cell inference of hematopoietic differentiation establishes five robust integrative clusters (ICs) with different master transcription factors, fusion partners and corresponding stages of B-lymphopoietic and early hemato-endothelial development: IRX-type differentiated (IC1), IRX-type undifferentiated (IC2), HOXA-type MLLT1 (IC3), HOXA-type MLLT3 (IC4), and HOXA-type AFF1 (IC5). Importantly, our deep mutational analysis reveals that the number of RAS pathway mutations predicts prognosis and that the most refractory subgroup of IC2 possesses 100% frequency and the heaviest burden of RAS pathway mutations. Our findings highlight the previously under-appreciated intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity of KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL and provide a rationale for the future development of genomics-guided risk stratification and individualized therapy.",
Evolution and modulation of antigen-specific T cell responses in melanoma patients,"Jani Huuhtanen, Liang Chen, Emmi Jokinen, Henna Kasanen, Tapio Lönnberg, Anna Kreutzman, Katriina Peltola, Micaela Hernberg, Chunlin Wang, Cassian Yee, Harri Lähdesmäki, Mark M. Davis, Satu Mustjoki",2022-10-11,"Analyzing antigen-specific T cell responses at scale has been challenging. Here, we analyze three types of T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data (antigen-specific TCRs, TCR-repertoire, and single-cell RNA + TCRαβ-sequencing data) from 515 patients with primary or metastatic melanoma and compare it to 783 healthy controls. Although melanoma-associated antigen (MAA) -specific TCRs are restricted to individuals, they share sequence similarities that allow us to build classifiers for predicting anti-MAA T cells. The frequency of anti-MAA T cells distinguishes melanoma patients from healthy and predicts metastatic recurrence from primary melanoma. Anti-MAA T cells have stem-like properties and frequent interactions with regulatory T cells and tumor cells via Galectin9-TIM3 and PVR-TIGIT -axes, respectively. In the responding patients, the number of expanded anti-MAA clones are higher after the anti-PD1(+anti-CTLA4) therapy and the exhaustion phenotype is rescued.

Angiocrine extracellular vesicles impose mesenchymal reprogramming upon proneural glioma stem cells,"Lata Adnani, Jordan Kassouf, Brian Meehan, Cristiana Spinelli, Nadim Tawil, Ichiro Nakano, Janusz Rak",2022-09-19,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable form of primary astrocytic brain tumor driven by glioma stem cell (GSC) compartment closely associated with the vascular niche. GSC phenotypes are heterogeneous and range from proneural to mesenchymal-like, the latter characterised by greater invasiveness. Here we document the secretory (angiocrine) role of endothelial cells and their derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as drivers of proneural-to-mesenchymal reprogramming of GSCs. These changes involve activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and NFκB, and inactivation of NOTCH, while altering responsiveness to chemotherapy and driving infiltrative growth in the brain. Our findings suggest that EV-mediated angiocrine interactions impact the nature of cellular stemness in GBM with implications for disease biology and therapy.",
Conserved features of TERT promoter duplications reveal an activation mechanism that mimics hotspot mutations in cancer,"Carter J. Barger, Abigail K. Suwala, Katarzyna M. Soczek, Albert S.

Costello",2022-09-16,"Mutations in the TERT promoter represent the genetic underpinnings of tumor cell immortality. Beyond the two most common point mutations, which selectively recruit the ETS factor GABP to activate TERT, the significance of other variants is unknown. In seven cancer types, we identify duplications of wildtype sequence within the core promoter region of TERT that have strikingly similar features including an ETS motif, the duplication length and insertion site. The duplications recruit a GABP tetramer by virtue of the native ETS motif and its precisely spaced duplicated counterpart, activate the promoter and are clonal in a TERT expressing multifocal glioblastoma. We conclude that recurrent TERT promoter duplications are functionally and mechanistically equivalent to the hotspot mutations that confer tumor cell immortality. The shared mechanism of these divergent somatic genetic alterations suggests a strong selective pressure for recruitment of the GABP tetramer to activate TERT.",
USP14 promotes tryptophan metabolism and immune suppression by stabilizing IDO1 in colorectal cancer,"Dongni Shi, Xianqiu Wu, Yunting Jian, Junye Wang, Chengmei Huang, Shuang Mo, Yue Li, Fengtian Li, Chao Zhang, Dongsheng Zhang, Huizhong Zhang, Huilin Huang, Xin Chen, Y.

However, IDO1 inhibitors have shown disappointing therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials, mainly because of the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Here, we show a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of IDO1 regulated by a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme, USP14, in colorectal cancer (CRC). Overexpression of USP14 promotes tryptophan metabolism and T-cell dysfunction by stabilizing the IDO1 protein. Knockdown of USP14 or pharmacological targeting of USP14 decreases IDO1 expression, reverses suppression of cytotoxic T cells, and increases responsiveness to anti-PD-1 in a MC38 syngeneic mouse model. Importantly, suppression of USP14 has no effects on AhR activation induced by the IDO1 inhibitor. These findings highlight a relevant role of USP14 in post-translational regulation of IDO1 and in the suppression of antitumor immunity, suggesting that inhibition of USP14 may represent a promising strategy for CRC immunotherapy.",
Reactive oxygen species-responsive and Raman-traceable hydrogel combining photodynamic and immune therapy for postsurgical cancer treatment,"Yiyi Zhang, Sidan Tian, Liping Huang, Yanan Li, Yuan Lu, Hongyu Li, Guiping Chen, Fanling Meng, Gang L. Liu, Xiangliang Yang, Jiasheng Tu, Chunmeng Sun, Liang Luo",2022-08-05,"Combining immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy with photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds great potential in treating immunologically “cold” tumors, but photo-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) can inevitably damage co-administered ICB antibodies, hence hampering the therapeutic outcome. Here we create a ROS-responsive hydrogel to realize the sustained co-delivery of photosensitizers and ICB antibodies. During PDT, the hydrogel skeleton poly(deca-4,6-diynedioic acid) (PDDA) protects ICB antibodies by scavenging the harmful ROS, and at the same time, triggers the gradual degradation of the hydrogel to release the drugs in a controlled manner. More interestingly, we can visualize the ROS-responsive hydrogel degradation by Raman imaging, given the ultrastrong and degradation-correlative Raman signal of PDDA in the cellular silent window. A single administration of the hydrogel not only completely inhibits the long-term postoperative recurrence and metastasis of 4T1-tumor-bearing mice, but also effectively restrains the growth of re-challenged tumors. The PDDA-based ROS-responsive hydrogel herein paves a promising way for the durable synergy of PDT and ICB therapy.",

To understand the mechanism driving on-target anti-leukemia activity of this compound class, here we dissect the expression dynamics of the bone marrow leukemia cells of patients treated with HDACi and reconstitute the EVI1 chromatin-associated co-transcriptional complex merging on the role of proliferation-associated 2G4 (PA2G4) protein. PA2G4 overexpression rescues AML cells from the inhibitory effects of HDACis, while genetic and small molecule inhibition of PA2G4 abrogates EVI1 in 3q26 AML cells, including in patient-derived leukemia xenografts. This study positions PA2G4 at the crosstalk of the EVI1 leukemogenic signal for developing new therapeutics and urges the use of HDACis-based combination therapies in patients with 3q26 AML.",
The comparison of cancer gene mutation frequencies in Chinese and U.S. patient populations,"Fayang Ma, Kyle Laster, Zigang Dong",2022-09-26,"Knowing the mutation frequency of cancer genes in China is crucial for reducing the global health burden. We integrate the tumor epidemiological statistics with cancer gene mutation rates identified in 11,948 cancer patients to determine their weighted proportions within a Chinese cancer patient cohort. TP53 (51.4%), LRP1B (13.4%), PIK3CA (11.6%), KRAS (11.1%), EGFR (10.6%), and APC (10.5%) are identified as the top mutated cancer genes in China. Additionally, 18 common cancer types from both China and U.S. cohorts are analyzed and classified into three patterns principally based upon TP53 mutation rates: TP53-Top, TP53-Plus, and Non-TP53. Next, corresponding similarities and prominent differences are identified upon comparing the mutational profiles from both cohorts. Finally, the potential population-specific and environmental risk factors underlying the disparities in cancer gene mutation rates between the U.S. and China are analyzed. Here, we show and compare the mutation rates of cancer genes in Chinese and U.S. population cohorts, for a better understanding of the associated etiological and epidemiological factors, which are important for cancer prevention and therapy.",

ARID1A is an epigenetic regulator mutated in approximately 5% of non-hypermutated CRC tumors. Here we show that anti-EGFR but not anti-VEGF treatment enriches for emerging ARID1A mutations in CRC patients. In addition, we find that patients with ARID1A mutations, at baseline, are associated with worse outcome when treated with cetuximab- but not bevacizumab-containing therapies; thus, this suggests that ARID1A mutations may provide both an acquired and intrinsic mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. We find that, ARID1A and EGFR-pathway genetic alterations are mutually exclusive across lung and colorectal cancers, further supporting a functional connection between these pathways. Our results not only suggest that ARID1A could be potentially used as a predictive biomarker for cetuximab treatment decisions but also provide a rationale for exploring therapeutic MAPK inhibition in an unexpected but genetically defined segment of CRC patients.",

Here, we demonstrate that cell adhesion-related genes are predominantly enriched in DNMT3A-mutant AML cells and identify that graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) display an anti-leukemia effect specifically against these mutated cells. Mechanistically, GDYO directly interacts with integrin β2 (ITGB2) and c-type mannose receptor (MRC2), which facilitate the attachment and cellular uptake of GDYO. Furthermore, GDYO binds to actin and prevents actin polymerization, thus disrupting the actin cytoskeleton and eventually leading to cell apoptosis. Finally, we validate the in vivo safety and therapeutic potential of GDYO against DNMT3A-mutant AML cells. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GDYO is an efficient and specific drug candidate against DNMT3A-mutant AML.",
The cholesterol uptake regulator PCSK9 promotes and is a therapeutic target in APC/KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer,"Chi Chun Wong, Jian-Lin Wu, Fenfen Ji, Wei Kang, Xiqing Bian, Huarong Chen, Lam-Shing Chan, Simson Tsz Yat Luk, Samuel Tong, Jiaying Xu, Qiming Zhou, Dabin Liu, Hao Su, Hongyan Gou, Alvin Ho-Kwan Cheung, Ka Fai To, Zongwei Cai, Jerry W. Shay, Jun Yu",2022-07-08,"Therapeutic targeting of KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) is an unmet need. Here, we show that Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin type 9 (PSCK9) promotes APC/KRAS-mutant CRC and is a therapeutic target. Using CRC patient cohorts, isogenic cell lines and transgenic mice, we identify that de novo cholesterol biosynthesis is induced in APC/KRAS mutant CRC, accompanied by increased geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP)─a metabolite necessary for KRAS activation. PCSK9 is the top up-regulated cholesterol-related gene. PCSK9 depletion represses APC/KRAS-mutant CRC cell growth in vitro and in vivo, whereas PCSK9 overexpression induces oncogenesis. Mechanistically, PCSK9 reduces cholesterol uptake but induces cholesterol de novo biosynthesis and GGPP accumulation. GGPP is a pivotal metabolite downstream of PCSK9 by activating KRAS/MEK/ERK signaling. PCSK9 inhibitors suppress growth of APC/KRAS-mutant CRC cells, organoids and xenografts, especially in combination with simvastatin. PCSK9 overexpression predicts poor survival of APC/KRAS-mutant CRC patients. Together, cholesterol homeostasis regulator PCSK9 promotes APC/KRAS-mutant CRC via GGPP-KRAS/MEK/ERK axis and is a therapeutic target.",
Zebrafish Avatar-test forecasts clinical response to chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer,"Bruna Costa, Marta F. Estrada, António Gomes, Laura M. Fernandez, José M.

Here, we conduct a clinical study to validate the zebrafish patient-derived xenograft model (zAvatar) as a fast predictive platform for personalized treatment in colorectal cancer. zAvatars are generated with patient tumor cells, treated exactly with the same therapy as their corresponding patient and analyzed at single-cell resolution. By individually comparing the clinical responses of 55 patients with their zAvatar-test, we develop a decision tree model integrating tumor stage, zAvatar-apoptosis, and zAvatar-metastatic potential. This model accurately forecasts patient progression with 91% accuracy. Importantly, patients with a sensitive zAvatar-test exhibit longer progression-free survival compared to those with a resistant test. We propose the zAvatar-test as a rapid approach to guide clinical decisions, optimizing treatment options and improving the survival of cancer patients.",

The efficacy of lete-cel treatment in 45 synovial sarcoma patients (NCT01343043) has been previously reported, however, biomarkers predictive of response and resistance remain to be better defined. This post-hoc analysis identifies associations of response to lete-cel with lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen (LDR), product attributes, cell expansion, cytokines, and tumor gene expression. Responders have higher IL-15 levels pre-infusion (p = 0.011) and receive a higher number of transduced effector memory (CD45RA- CCR7-) CD8 + cells per kg (p = 0.039). Post-infusion, responders have increased IFNγ, IL-6, and peak cell expansion (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p = 0.016, respectively). Analysis of tumor samples post-treatment illustrates lete-cel infiltration and a decrease in expression of macrophage genes, suggesting remodeling of the tumor microenvironment.

Applying imaging-guided sampling we observe three evolutionary patterns, including relapse driven by a single-cell expansion, competing/co-existing sub-clones, and unique sub-clones at distinct locations. While we do not find the unique relapse sub-clone in the baseline focal lesion(s), we show a close phylogenetic relationship between baseline focal lesions and relapse disease, highlighting focal lesions as hotspots of tumor evolution. In patients with ≥3 focal lesions on positron-emission-tomography at diagnosis, relapse is driven by multiple distinct sub-clones, whereas in other patients, a single-cell expansion is typically seen (p < 0.01). Notably, we observe resistant sub-clones that can be hidden over years, suggesting that a prerequisite for curative therapies would be to overcome not only tumor heterogeneity but also dormancy.",
Sintilimab combined with anlotinib and chemotherapy as second-line or later therapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a phase II clinical trial,"Xiao Han, Jun Guo, Lingyu Li, Yong Huang, Xue Meng, Linlin Wang, Hui Zhu, Xiangjiao Meng, Qian Shao, Xing Li, Yan Zhang, Jin Wang, Yanhua Chen, Yingjie Zhang, Yiru Chen, Changbin Zhu, Zhehai Wang",2024-09-16,"Treatment options for patients with relapsed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) remain scarce. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining anlotinib and sintilimab plus chemotherapy as a second line or later therapy for ES-SCLC patients. This is a phase II clinical trial (ChiCTR2100049390) conducting at Shandong Cancer Hospital. Patients with ES-SCLC and received at least one prior systemic treatment were enrolled. The trial design involved a combination therapy (sintilimab, anlotinib, and nab-paclitaxel) administered over six 21-day cycles, followed by maintenance sintilimab therapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Circulating tumor DNA sequencing was employed for exploratory analysis. From July 2021 to April 2023, 25 eligible patients were enrolled. The confirmed ORR was 60% (95% CI: 38.7–78.9%) and the DCR was 76% (95% CI: 54.9–90.6%). The mPFS was 6.0 months (95% CI: 5.4–9.7), and the 6-month PFS rate was 49.2%. The mOS was 13.4 months (95% CI: 11.8-NR), with a 12-month survival rate of 62.2%. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 80% of patients, with the most common being fatigue (40%) and nausea (32%). TRAEs of Grade 3 or higher were reported in 12% of patients. ctDNA analysis indicated that low on-treatment blood tumor mutation burden was associated with longer PFS and OS and a potential role of KMT2D mutation in treatment resistance. This combination therapy shows promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile as a second-line or later treatment for ES-SCLC, with genomic insights providing potential biomarkers for treatment response.",

Here we sequence the mitochondrial genomes of 384 localized prostate cancer patients, and identify a median of one mitochondrial single-nucleotide variant (mtSNV) per patient. Some of these mtSNVs occur in recurrent mutational hotspots and associate with aggressive disease. Younger patients have fewer mtSNVs than those who diagnosed at an older age. We demonstrate strong links between mitochondrial and nuclear mutational profiles, with co-occurrence between specific mutations. For example, certain control region mtSNVs co-occur with gain of the MYC oncogene, and these mutations are jointly associated with patient survival. These data demonstrate frequent mitochondrial mutation in prostate cancer, and suggest interplay between nuclear and mitochondrial mutational profiles in prostate cancer.",
Clinical efficacy of enhanced recovery surgery in Da Vinci robot-assisted pancreatoduodenectomy,"Zhenxing Liu, Honghong Chen, Zhengbiao Li, Jinlong Liang, Tao Zhang, Weiwei Ning, Jiwei Wang",2024-09-15,"Da Vinci robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy offers advantages, including minimal invasiveness, precise, and safe procedures. This study aimed to investigate the clinical effectiveness of implementing enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) concepts in Da Vinci robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy. A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 62 patients who underwent Da Vinci robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy between January 2018 and December 2022. Among these patients, 30 were managed with ERAS principles, while 32 were managed using traditional perioperative management protocols. Surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative oral intake time, time to return of bowel function, time to ambulation, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, fluid replacement volume, length of hospital stay, total hospital expenses, complications, and patient satisfaction were recorded and compared between the two groups. Postoperative follow-up included assessment of postoperative functional scores, reoperation rates, SF-36 quality of life scores, and survival rates. The average follow-up time was 35.6 months (range: 12–56 months). There were no statistically significant differences in general characteristics, including age, surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, and preoperative medical history between the two groups (P > 0.05). Compared to the control group, the intervention group had an earlier postoperative oral intake time, faster return of bowel function, rapid ambulation, and shorter hospital stays (P < 0.05). The intervention group also had lower postoperative VAS scores, lower fluid replacement volume, lower total hospital expenses, and a lower rate of complications (P < 0.05). Patient satisfaction was higher in the intervention group (P < 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in two-year functional scores, reoperation rates, quality of life scores, and survival rates (P > 0.05). Implementing ERAS principles in Da Vinci robot-assisted pancreaticoduodenectomy substantially expedited postoperative recovery, lowered pain scores, and diminished complications. However, there were no notable differences in long-term outcomes between the two groups.","Enhanced recovery after surgery, Da Vinci, Robot, Pancreaticoduodenectomy, Efficacy"

Chandler",2019-08-07,"ARID1A and PI3-Kinase (PI3K) pathway alterations are common in neoplasms originating from the uterine endometrium. Here we show that monoallelic loss of ARID1A in the mouse endometrial epithelium is sufficient for vaginal bleeding when combined with PI3K activation. Sorted mutant epithelial cells display gene expression and promoter chromatin signatures associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We further show that ARID1A is bound to promoters with open chromatin, but ARID1A loss leads to increased promoter chromatin accessibility and the expression of EMT genes. PI3K activation partially rescues the mesenchymal phenotypes driven by ARID1A loss through antagonism of ARID1A target gene expression, resulting in partial EMT and invasion. We propose that ARID1A normally maintains endometrial epithelial cell identity by repressing mesenchymal cell fates, and that coexistent ARID1A and PI3K mutations promote epithelial transdifferentiation and collective invasion. Broadly, our findings support a role for collective epithelial invasion in the spread of abnormal endometrial tissue.",

Twenty-one (1.8%) have Lynch syndrome while 106 (9.0%) have somatic hypermethylation or mutations in the mismatch repair genes. The population prevalence of Lynch syndrome is 0.442%. We discover a translocation disrupting MLH1 and three mutations in MSH6 and PMS2 that increase endometrial, colorectal, brain and ovarian cancer risk.

However, the efficacy and optimal administration of diuretics in preventing CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity remain to be established. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combining furosemide and mannitol to prevent CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. This was a post-hoc analysis of pooled data from a multicenter, retrospective, observational study, including 396 patients who received one or two diuretics for CDDP-based chemotherapy, compared using propensity score matching. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for nephrotoxicity. There was no significant difference in the incidence of nephrotoxicity between the two groups (22.2% vs. 28.3%, P = 0.416). Hypertension, CDDP dose ≥ 75 mg/m2, and no magnesium supplementation were identified as risk factors for nephrotoxicity, whereas the use of diuretics was not found to be a risk factor. The combination of furosemide and mannitol showed no advantage over a single diuretic in preventing CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. The renal function of patients receiving CDDP-based chemotherapy (≥ 75 mg/m2) and that of those with hypertension should be carefully monitored. Magnesium supplementation is important for these patients.","Cisplatin, Nephrotoxicity, Renal failure, Diuretics, Furosemide, Mannitol"

ESR1 mutations selected by prior hormone therapy are shown to be frequently sub clonal, with ESR1 ctDNA dynamics offering limited prediction of clinical outcome.

The images were labeled by three oral pathologists, resulting in 14,535 images with the corresponding pathologists’ annotations. Data from three pathologists who provided the same diagnosis were labeled as ground truth (GT) and used for testing. We investigated six models trained using the annotations of (1) pathologist A, (2) pathologist B, (3) pathologist C, (4) GT, (5) majority voting, and (6) a probabilistic model. We divided the test by cross-validation per slide dataset and examined the classification performance of the CNN with a ResNet50 baseline. Statistical evaluation was performed repeatedly and independently using every slide 10 times as test data. For the area under the curve, three cases showed the highest values (0.861, 0.955, and 0.991) for the probabilistic model. Regarding accuracy, two cases showed the highest values (0.988 and 0.967). For the models using the pathologists and GT annotations, many slides showed very low accuracy and large variations across tests. Hence, the classifier trained with probabilistic labels provided the optimal CNN for oral exfoliative cytology considering diagnoses from multiple pathologists.

Here we show that elevated hyperpolarised [1-13C]lactate signal in prostate cancer compared to the benign prostate is primarily driven by increased tumour epithelial cell density and vascularity, rather than differences in epithelial lactate concentration between tumour and normal. We also demonstrate that some tumours of the cribriform subtype may lack [1-13C]lactate labelling, which is explained by lower epithelial lactate dehydrogenase expression, higher mitochondrial pyruvate carrier density, and increased lipid abundance compared to lactate-rich non-cribriform lesions. These findings highlight the potential of combining spatial metabolic imaging tools across scales to identify clinically significant metabolic phenotypes in prostate cancer.",
Combined effect of the pro-apoptotic rhTRAIL protein and HSV-1 virus in head and neck cancer cell lines,"Lucas Bravo Perina, Izabela Natalia Faria Gomes, Ana Rúbia Alcantara Pelloso, Viviane Aline Oliveira Silva, Lidia Maria Rebolho Batista Arantes, Matias Eliseo Melendez",2023-10-21,"Knowledge on the molecular and clinical characteristics of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is vast.

We observed a difference in the modulation profile of proteins related to apoptotic pathways in the studied cell lines. The HCB289 exhibited caspase-9 activation in the presence of the HSV-1 virus, while the UD-SCC-2 exhibited caspase-8 activation in the presence of rhTRAIL. Both cell lines exhibited PARP activation by combining rhTRAIL and HSV-1 virus treatment. Flow cytometry analysis exhibited greater induction of late apoptosis for the HCB289 and UD-SCC-2 after the combination treatment of the HSV-1 and rhTRAIL.

Due to highly clinical symptoms out of the negative with inflammatory smears reported, one hundred and ten patients were randomly advised for biopsy and HPV 16/18 DNA analysis by a gynaecologist to correlate negative smears included in the study. Pap smear reports revealed that 1178 (94.24%) were negative for intraepithelial lesions (NILM) with inflammatory smears, 23 (1.84%) smears showed low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), 12 (0.96%) smears showed high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, and 37 (2.96%) smears showed an atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASC-US).

On the other hand, HPV 16/18 DNA was detected as positive in 87 out of 110. The high positivity of HPV in biopsied cases where frank cervical cancer and at-risk cancer were also observed in the negative smear-screened patients reveals that the HPV status and clinical history of the patients will be quite helpful to the cytologist for accurate reporting, and suggests that a negative HPV DNA result may be a stronger predictor of cervical cancer risk than a negative Pap test.","Pap smear, HPV, Squamous Intraepithelial lesion-SIL, Cervical cancer"

Adverse events occurred in all patients, mainly grade 1–2. There was no correlation between PET/CT evaluation and pathological response or progression-free survival/overall survival. Patients with pathological response showed tumor beds with high tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Cytokines and chemokines analysis showed the combination therapy significantly increases the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in both responders and non-responders.

Zellars, Tim Lautenschlaeger, Jordan A. Holmes",2024-07-31,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of early incomplete follow-up on overall survival among stage I lung cancer patients. Patients with clinical stage I lung cancer at our institution between 2007 and 2016 were identified (N = 1111). Exclusions included < 18 years of age (N = 2), missing stage or demographics (N = 56), incomplete appointment data or had only one scheduled appointment (N = 351), or did not survive for at least 1 year after diagnosis (N = 120). Missed appointments were defined as unattended follow-up appointments within the first year of diagnosis without an attended appointment in the subsequent 60 days. The primary outcome was the hazard ratio (HR) for death associated per 10% increase in missed oncology follow-up appointments. Univariable and descriptive statistics were performed, and a multivariable landmark Cox regression model was created to examine the effect of missed oncology follow-up on survival. A total of 582 patients were analyzed with median follow-up of 3.2 years and median age of 69 years. On multivariable analysis controlling for age, sex, race, insurance status, and definitive treatment type the HR for death was 1.44 (95% CI 1.05–1.97) for every 10% increase in missed appointments. Incomplete oncologic follow-up may negatively impact overall survival among survivors of early-stage lung cancer.","Survivorship, Follow up, Survival, Lung cancer, Surveillance"
Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 (LILRB1) protects human multiple myeloma cells from ferroptosis by maintaining cholesterol homeostasis,"Miao Xian, Qiang Wang, Liuling Xiao, Ling Zhong, Wei Xiong, Lingqun Ye, Pan Su, Chuanchao Zhang, Yabo Li, Robert Z. Orlowski, Fenghuang Zhan, Siddhartha Ganguly, Youli Zu, Jianfei Qian, Qing Yi",2024-07-09,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic malignancy characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. MM patients with aggressive progression have poor survival, emphasizing the urgent need for identifying new therapeutic targets. Here, we show that the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B1 (LILRB1), a transmembrane receptor conducting negative immune response, is a top-ranked gene associated with poor prognosis in MM patients. LILRB1 deficiency inhibits MM progression in vivo by enhancing the ferroptosis of MM cells. Mechanistic studies reveal that LILRB1 forms a complex with the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDLR adapter protein 1 (LDLRAP1) to facilitate LDL/cholesterol uptake. Loss of LILRB1 impairs cholesterol uptake but activates the de novo cholesterol synthesis pathway to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis, leading to the decrease of anti-ferroptotic metabolite squalene. Our study uncovers the function of LILRB1 in regulating cholesterol metabolism and protecting MM cells from ferroptosis, implicating LILRB1 as a promising therapeutic target for MM patients.",
Modelling of the time to death of breast cancer patients at Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital,"Malkitu Tasfa, Kasahun Takele, Million Wesenu",2024-10-15,"Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death and is a frequently diagnosed cancer among women worldwide. It is becoming a challenging health condition in Ethiopia with a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The main aim of this study was to model the time to death in breast cancer patients at Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital. A retrospective cohort study was carried out from April 1st, 2020, to April 1st, 2023, and 296 women were included in the study. We used nonparametric methods and Bayesian accelerated failure time models (with Laplace approximation) to identify risk factors and choose a model fitting breast cancer patient data. Model comparison was performed using the marginal likelihood, deviance information criterion and Watanabe Akaike information criterion. From the total of 296 patients in the study, 56 (18.9%) died. The estimated median survival time was 33 months. The log-rank test showed that age group, stage, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, and comorbidity were potential risk factors associated with the time to death in breast cancer patients at the 5% level of significance. The Bayesian Weibull accelerated failure time model was found to be the best fitted model for predicting the survival time of patients with minimum DIC (520.39) and WAIC (521.59) values. The final Bayesian Weibull AFT model with the integrated nested Laplace approximation estimation technique revealed that age group, stage, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, and comorbidity were significantly associated with the time to death in breast cancer patients. Individuals older than 65 years, with stage IV disease, drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes and having comorbidities had shortened survival times in patients with breast cancer. Hence, Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital and related bodies should work on awareness creation to reduce smoking habits and alcohol use as well as give due attention to elderly and stage IV breast cancer patients during intervention.","Bayesian AFT model, Breast cancer, Death, INLA, Survival analysis"
Harnessing virus flexibility to selectively capture and profile rare circulating target cells for precise cancer subtyping,"Hui-Da Li, Yuan-Qiang Chen, Yan Li, Xing Wei, Si-Yi Wang, Ying Cao, Rui Wang, Cong Wang, Jing-Yue Li, Jian-Yi Li, Hong-Ming Ding, Ting Yang, Jian-Hua Wang, Chuanbin Mao",2024-07-12,"The effective isolation of rare target cells, such as circulating tumor cells, from whole blood is still challenging due to the lack of a capturing surface with strong target-binding affinity and non-target-cell resistance. Here we present a solution leveraging the flexibility of bacterial virus (phage) nanofibers with their sidewalls displaying target circulating tumor cell-specific aptamers and their ends tethered to magnetic beads. Such flexible phages, with low stiffness and Young’s modulus, can twist and adapt to recognize the cell receptors, energetically enhancing target cell capturing and entropically discouraging non-target cells (white blood cells) adsorption. The magnetic beads with flexible phages can isolate and count target cells with significant increase in cell affinity and reduction in non-target cell absorption compared to magnetic beads having rigid phages. This differentiates breast cancer patients and healthy donors, with impressive area under the curve (0.991) at the optimal detection threshold (>4 target cells mL−1). Immunostaining of captured circulating tumor cells precisely determines breast cancer subtypes with a diagnostic accuracy of 91.07%. Our study reveals the power of viral mechanical attributes in designing surfaces with superior target binding and non-target anti-fouling.",
Expression of variant isoforms of the tyrosine kinase SYK differentially regulates cervical cancer progression through PI3K/AKT pathway,"Bingjie Lin, Qixin Wang, Xin Wang, Hongjian Wei, Xiaojing Nie, Li Li, Yonghua Shi",2024-11-23,"Invasion and metastasis are the main reasons for the poor prognosis of patients with cervical cancer(CC). SYK is closely related to tumor development. However, the functions of its two isoforms, SYK (L) or SYK (S), are not fully understood to date. In this study, we investigated their biologic functions and possible prognostic values in CC. qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of SYK and two variant isoforms in cervical cancer tissues and cells. The association of SYK(L) and SYK(S) with Clinical pathological parameters were evaluated. The migration and invasion was detected by scratch assay and transwell. Western blot was conducted to measure the changes of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway proteins in cervical cancer cells. LY294002 (inhibitor of PI3K/AKT pathway) and IGF-1 (activator of PI3K/AKT pathway)  were applied to evaluate the contribution of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in cervical cancer cells. The expression of SYK(S) in cervical cancer tissues was significantly higher than that of SYK(L). SYK(L) and SYK(S) were correlated with muscular infiltration, SYK(L) high expression had a better prognosis, whereas SYK(S) high expression predicted a worse disease outcome. Cox multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that SYK(L) expression was an independent prognostic factor. SYK(L) significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion, while SYK(S) showed the opposite effects. LY294002 blocked SYK (L) knockdown-induced enhancement of migration and invasion as well as the expression EMT-related markers, whereas IGF-1 rescued the decreased migration, invasion and EMT induced by SYK (S) knockdown. The results suggest that SYK(L) and SYK(S) are involved in the progression of cervical cancer through PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and may serve as potential targets for clinical treatment of advanced cervical cancer.","Cervical cancer, SYK(L), SYK(S), PI3K/AKT, Prognosis"
Intercostal approach VATS is feasible for large-sized anterior mediastinal tumors,"Lei Ke, Jiacong Liu, Yongfeng Shuai, Linhai Zhu, Cheng He, Xuhua Huang, Wang Lv, Luming Wang, Jian Hu",2024-07-26,"There is no consensus about whether relatively large mediastinal tumors (≥ 5.0 cm) are suitable for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Therefore, this study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of intercostal approach VATS for large-sized anterior mediastinal tumors (5.0–10.0 cm) with no invasion to the surrounding tissues and organs. A total of 129 patients with anterior mediastinal tumors who received surgery in our hospital between January 2018 and July 2022 were consecutively enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on mediastinal tumor diameter: Group A (tumor size between 1.0 and 4.9 cm) and Group B (tumor size between 5.0 and 10.0 cm). The primary endpoints were operation time, blood loss, and postoperative pain, and the secondary endpoints were the volume of drainage, drainage duration, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative complications. Significant differences were found in the volume of drainage between the two groups (Group A: 218.4 ± 140.6, Group B: 398.9 ± 369.3, P < 0.001). However, no differences were found in operation time, blood loss, drainage duration, postoperative hospital stay and duration of postoperative oral analgesics (P > 0.05). In addition, there existed no significant differences in the postoperative complications. Intercostal approach VATS is regarded as a feasible and safe surgical method for large-sized anterior mediastinal tumors (5.0–10.0 cm) with no invasion to the surrounding tissues and organs.","Anterior mediastinal tumor, Intercostal approach video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, Tumor size"
Sleep traits and breast cancer risk: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study,"Jing Feng, Yixue Wen, Zhen Zhang, Ye Zhang",2024-07-31,"Globally, breast cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related incidence and mortality among females. Research has shown that sleep patterns significantly influence tumor onset and progression. In this research, the association was examined through the application of a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach. For the analysis of seven sleep patterns, genetic tools were sourced from both the UK Biobank and 23andMe, including morning/evening person (chronotype) n = 177,604, morning person (chronotype) n = 248,094, daytime dozing/sleepiness n = 193,472, getting up in the morning n = 193,717, and sleeplessness n = 193,987; sleep duration n = 192,810; and nap during the day n = 166,853. The Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) supplied genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data, including 133,384 breast cancer cases and 113,789 controls, alongside subtype-specific data with 106,278 cases and 91,477 controls. We discovered that chronotype encompasses both morning and evening types contributes to the risk of overall breast cancer. While daytime dozing and morning person (chronotype) are linked to a lower risk of breast cancer in general, In subtype-specific analyses, morning person (chronotype) was negatively associated with luminal B, HER2-negative-like, and daytime dozing was negatively correlated with luminal A-like, luminal B-like, and HER2-enriched-like. The study corroborates that chronotype is a danger element for breast cancer, aligning with previous observational findings. The association between being a morning person (chronotype) or having daytime dozing and a decreased risk of breast cancer underscores the significance of sleep patterns in formulating strategies for cancer prevention.","Sleep traits, Chronotype, Daytime dozing, Breast cancer, Mendelian randomization"
Advancing frontline early pancreatic cancer detection using within-class feature extraction in FTIR spectroscopy,"Zheng Tang, Edward Duckworth, Benjamin Mora, Bilal Al - Sarireh, Matthew Mortimer, Debdulal Roy",2024-11-22,"This study introduces a novel approach for the early detection of pancreatic cancer through biofluid spectroscopy, leveraging a unique machine learning pipeline comprising class-specific principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and support vector machine (SVM) in both real patient and synthetic data. By conducting separate PCA on cancerous and non-cancerous samples and integrating the projections prior to LDA and SVM classification, we demonstrate significantly improved diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional methods. This methodology not only enhances predictive performance but also offers deeper insights into the influence of molecular spectra on model efficacy. Our findings, validated on real patient data, suggest a promising avenue for developing non-invasive, accurate diagnostic tools for early-stage pancreatic cancer detection.",
The effect of lymph node ratio on the surgical outcomes in patients with colorectal cancer,"Zhan-Xiang Hai, Dong Peng, Zi-Wei Li, Fei Liu, Xu-Rui Liu, Chun-Yi Wang",2024-07-31,"The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of lymph node ratio (LNR) on the short-term and long-term outcomes of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who underwent radical CRC surgery. We retrospectively collected CRC patients who underwent radical surgery from Jan 2011 to Jan 2020 in a single-center hospital. The patients were divided into the high LNR group and the low group according to the median. The baseline information and the short-term outcomes were compared between the high group and the low group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to analyze the independent predictors for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). A 1:1 proportional propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the selection bias between the two groups. Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the OS and DFS between the two groups in different T stages. A total of 1434 CRC patients undergoing radical surgery were enrolled in this study, and there were 730 (50.9%) patients in the low LNR group and 704 (49.1%) patients in the high LNR group. After the PSM, there were 618 patients in both groups, the baseline characteristics between the two groups had no significant difference (p > 0.05). After comparing the Surgery-related information and The Short-term outcomes, the high LNR group had a longer hospital stay (after PSM, p < 0.01). In univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, age (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), tumor location (univariate analysis, p = 0.020; multivariate analysis, p = 0.024), lymph-vascular space invasion (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), cancer nodules (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), tumor size (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), LNR (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), and overall complications (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01) were independent risk factors for OS, and age (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), tumor location (univariate analysis, p = 0.032; multivariate analysis, p = 0.031), T stage (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p = 0.014), lymph-vascular space invasion (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), cancer nodules (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), LNR (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01), and overall complications (univariate analysis, p < 0.01; multivariate analysis, p < 0.01) were identified as independent risk factors for DFS. The high LNR group had a worse OS in T3 (p < 0.01) and T4 (p < 0.01) as well as a worse DFS in T3 (p < 0.01) and T4 (p < 0.01). No association was found between LNR and postoperative complications, but the high LNR group had a longer hospital stay. LNR was identified as an independent predictor for OS and DFS. Furthermore, high LNR had a worse OS and DFS under T3 and T4 stages. Therefore, LNR was more prognostically significant for CRC patients under T3 and T4 stages.","Lymph node ratio, Colorectal cancer, Complications, Survival, Surgery"
Dementia incidence varied by anticancer drugs and molecular targeted therapy in a population-based cohort study,"Eun Hye Lee, Danbee Kang, Jin Lee, Sang Won Seo, Chi-Hun Kim, Juhee Cho",2024-07-30,"Anticancer drugs may affect the incidence of dementia by modulating the common pathophysiology between cancer and dementia. However, there is a paucity of research that focused on anticancer drugs with different mechanisms of action and their associations with subtypes of dementia. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the incidence of dementia according to various groups of anticancer drugs. From the Korea National Health Insurance Service database, our retrospective population-based cohort study enrolled 116,506 cancer patients aged 65 years and older who received anticancer drugs between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2018. The hazard ratio was determined using Cox proportional hazards regression models, comparing each group of anticancer drugs to all other anticancer drugs, after adjusting for covariates. Antimetabolites (HR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.84–0.97) and molecular targeted therapies (HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.49–0.74) were associated with a decreased incidence of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), but not with vascular dementia. Among molecular targeted therapies, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.46–0.79) and multikinase inhibitors (HR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.27–0.89) were associated with a low incidence of DAT only. Our findings highlight the potential for targeted repurposing of anticancer drugs to prevent dementia.","Alzheimer’s disease, Vascular dementia, Dementia, Incidence, Cancer, Anticancer drug"
Adeno-associated virus delivered CXCL9 sensitizes glioblastoma to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade,"Christina A. von Roemeling, Jeet A. Patel, Savannah L.

Hoang-Minh, Frances L. Weidert, Todd E. Golde, Duane A. Mitchell",2024-07-12,"There are numerous mechanisms by which glioblastoma cells evade immunological detection, underscoring the need for strategic combinatorial treatments to achieve appreciable therapeutic effects. However, developing combination therapies is difficult due to dose-limiting toxicities, blood-brain-barrier, and suppressive tumor microenvironment. Glioblastoma is notoriously devoid of lymphocytes driven in part by a paucity of lymphocyte trafficking factors necessary to prompt their recruitment and activation. Herein, we develop a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy that enables focal and stable reconstitution of the tumor microenvironment with C-X-C motif ligand 9 (CXCL9), a powerful call-and-receive chemokine for lymphocytes. By manipulating local chemokine directional guidance, AAV-CXCL9 increases tumor infiltration by cytotoxic lymphocytes, sensitizing glioblastoma to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade in female preclinical tumor models. These effects are accompanied by immunologic signatures evocative of an inflamed tumor microenvironment. These findings support AAV gene therapy as an adjuvant for reconditioning glioblastoma immunogenicity given its safety profile, tropism, modularity, and off-the-shelf capability.",
Prospective appraisal of clinical diagnostic algorithms for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B infection,"Henry L. Y. Chan, Yao Hu, Katharina Malinowsky, Kairat Madin, Konstantin Kroeniger, Jinlin Hou, Ashish Sharma",2024-11-22,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often detected at advanced stages among patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV), underscoring the urgency for more precise surveillance tests. Here, we compare the clinical performance of the novel - GAAD (gender [biological sex], age, alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], protein-induced by vitamin K absence-II [PIVKA-II]) and GALAD (gender [biological sex], age, AFP, Lens-culinaris AFP [AFP-L3]), PIVKA-II) algorithms to assess the utility of AFP-L3 for distinguishing HCC from benign chronic liver disease (CLD) in Chinese patients with predominantly chronic HBV infection. Eligible adults were enrolled, and biomarkers were measured using Elecsys (Cobas) or µTASWAKO assays. In total, 411 participants provided serum samples (HCC, n = 176 [early-stage, n = 110]; CLD, n = 136; specificity n = 101). HBV was the underlying disease etiology for most participants (HCC, 95%; benign CLD, 72%). For GAAD (Cobas), GALAD (Cobas), and GALAD (µTASWAKO), AUCs were 93.1% (95% CI: 90.0–96.2), 93.2% (90.0–96.3), and 92.7% (88.4–96.9) for early-stage, and 95.6% (93.6–97.6), 95.6% (93.6–97.7), and 95.8% (93.2–98.3) for all-stage HCC, versus CLD, respectively. Interestingly, both GAAD and GALAD algorithms demonstrated comparable diagnostic performance regardless of disease etiology (HBV vs. non-HBV), presence of cirrhosis, geographic region, and within pan-tumor specificity panels (p < 0.001), indicating AFP-L3 may have a negligible role in HCC surveillance.","Hepatocellular carcinoma, Hepatitis B virus, Diagnostic algorithms, GAAD, GALAD"
Factors influencing parental fatigue in children with retinoblastoma based on the unpleasant symptoms theory,"ChangJuan Zeng, Na Du, Liangyu He, Hui Wang, Ting Zhao, Renbing Jia, Lin Li, Minglei Han, Lili Hou",2024-07-29,"Parents of children with retinoblastoma, the most common primary ocular malignant tumour in childhood, bear a heavy caregiving burden and are very susceptible to fatigue. However, little is known about their current status of fatigue and factors influencing fatigue; therefore,this study, based on the theory of unpleasant symptoms, and included 317 parents of children with retinoblastoma in China, whose general demographic data were collected, and on whom the fatigue severity scale (FSS), the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) and 2-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2) were administered, from 9 March to 1 June 2020. The parents’ FSS score and fatigue incidence were 4.41 ± 1.14 and 67.19%, respectively. The fatigue level was positively correlated with anxiety, depression, education, times of hospitalisations, and treatment types (r = 0.125–0.468, P < 0.05) and negatively correlated with health status, sleep quality, economic status, and family economic situation (r =  − 0.120 to − 0.322, P < 0.05). Parent’s anxiety level, being an only child and female sex of child influenced parents’ fatigue.

Santomasso",2024-11-23,"Patients who develop chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell-related immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) frequently undergo evaluation with electroencephalography (EEG). We hypothesize that EEG features and Synek scale score, a measure of degree of EEG abnormality, are associated with ICANS severity. Here, we performed a retrospective review of 125 adult patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) who received CAR-T cell therapy from 2010 to 2019, including 53 patients with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with 1928z CAR T cells (NCT01044069) and 72 patients with large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) treated with the commercial CAR T products axicabtagene ciloleucel or tisagenlecleucel. We collected video EEG monitoring (27 with B-ALL and 20 with LBCL) and recorded daily EEG features, Synek scores, and ICANS grade for 47 eligible patients. Synek scale and ICANS grade were positively correlated (correlation coefficient 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31–0.60). This was further corroborated in the univariable model associating high Synek scale (3 or 4) with high ICANS grade (OR = 15.2; 95%CI:7.8–29.7, p < 0.0001). EEG features such as discontinuity, absence of posterior dominant rhythm, and presence of generalized sharp waves were statistically significantly associated with higher ICANS grade in univariable models. In the multivariable model, discontinuity (OR = 4.2 (95%CI:1.3–13.8, p = 0.02) and absence of posterior dominant rhythm (OR = 10.5 (95%CI:4.6–23.9, p < 0.0001) were statistically associated with higher ICANS grade. Overall, EEG discontinuity and absence of posterior dominant rhythm were independently associated with higher severity of neurotoxicity. Further, our data suggest that Synek Scale, may be a severity marker for neurotoxicity.","ICANS, CAR T-cell therapy, EEG, Synek, Immune-related adverse events"

Here, we phenotyped innate and adaptive cells in human colorectal (CRC) and endometrial cancer. We found striking differences in γδ subsets and function in tumors compared to normal tissue, and in the γδ subsets present in tumor types. In CRC, an amphiregulin (AREG)-producing subset emerges, while endometrial cancer is infiltrated by cytotoxic cells. In humanized CRC models, tumors induced this AREG phenotype in Vδ1 cells after adoptive transfer. To exploit the beneficial roles of γδ cells for cell therapy, we developed an expansion method that enhanced cytotoxic function and boosted metabolic flexibility, while eliminating AREG production, achieving greater tumor infiltration and tumor clearance. This method has broad applications in cellular therapy as an ‘off-the-shelf’ treatment option.",

Our analysis reveals abnormally expanded MDC subpopulations across various tumors and distinguishes cell states that have often been grouped together, such as TREM2+ and FOLR2+ subpopulations. Using deconvolution approaches, we identify five subpopulations as independent prognostic markers, including states co-expressing TREM2 and PD-1, and FOLR2 and PDL-2. Additionally, TREM2 alone does not reliably predict cancer prognosis, as other TREM2+ macrophages show varied associations with prognosis depending on local cues. Validation in independent cohorts confirms that FOLR2-expressing macrophages correlate with poor clinical outcomes in ovarian and triple-negative breast cancers.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase maintains redox homeostasis and biosynthesis in LKB1-deficient KRAS-driven lung cancer,"Taijin Lan, Sara Arastu, Jarrick Lam, Hyungsin Kim, Wenping Wang, Samuel Wang, Vrushank Bhatt, Eduardo Cararo Lopes, Zhixian Hu, Michael Sun, Xuefei Luo, Jonathan M. Ghergurovich, Xiaoyang Su, Joshua D. Rabinowitz, Eileen White, Jessie Yanxiang Guo",2024-07-12,"Cancer cells depend on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to combat oxidative stress and support reductive biosynthesis. One major NADPH production route is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (committed step: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PD). Alternatives exist and can compensate in some tumors. Here, using genetically-engineered lung cancer mouse models, we show that G6PD ablation significantly suppresses KrasG12D/+;Lkb1-/- (KL) but not KrasG12D/+;P53-/- (KP) lung tumorigenesis. In vivo isotope tracing and metabolomics reveal that G6PD ablation significantly impairs NADPH generation, redox balance, and de novo lipogenesis in KL but not KP lung tumors. Mechanistically, in KL tumors, G6PD ablation activates p53, suppressing tumor growth. As tumors progress, G6PD-deficient KL tumors increase an alternative NADPH source from serine-driven one carbon metabolism, rendering associated tumor-derived cell lines sensitive to serine/glycine depletion. Thus, oncogenic driver mutations determine lung cancer dependence on G6PD, whose targeting is a potential therapeutic strategy for tumors harboring KRAS and LKB1 co-mutations.",

Batavia, Joel Greshock, Tommaso Mansi, Kristopher A. Standish",2024-06-01,"Accurate identification of genetic alterations in tumors, such as Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor, is crucial for treating with targeted therapies; however, molecular testing can delay patient care due to the time and tissue required. Successful development, validation, and deployment of an AI-based, biomarker-detection algorithm could reduce screening cost and accelerate patient recruitment. Here, we develop a deep-learning algorithm using >3000 H&E-stained whole slide images from patients with advanced urothelial cancers, optimized for high sensitivity to avoid ruling out trial-eligible patients. The algorithm is validated on a dataset of 350 patients, achieving an area under the curve of 0.75, specificity of 31.8% at 88.7% sensitivity, and projected 28.7% reduction in molecular testing. We successfully deploy the system in a non-interventional study comprising 89 global study clinical sites and demonstrate its potential to prioritize/deprioritize molecular testing resources and provide substantial cost savings in the drug development and clinical settings.",
Targeting SOX13 inhibits assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes to overcome ferroptosis resistance in gastric cancer,"Hui Yang, Qingqing Li, Xingxing Chen, Mingzhe Weng, Yakai Huang, Qiwen Chen, Xiaocen Liu, Haoyu Huang, Yanhuizhi Feng, Hanyu Zhou, Mengying Zhang, Weiya Pei, Xueqin Li, Qingsheng Fu, Liangyu Zhu, Yingying Wang, Xiang Kong, Kun Lv, Yan Zhang, Yangbai Sun, Mingzhe Ma",2024-05-20,"Therapeutic resistance represents a bottleneck to treatment in advanced gastric cancer (GC). Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death and is associated with anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy. Further investigations are required to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Ferroptosis-resistant GC cell lines are constructed. Dysregulated mRNAs between ferroptosis-resistant and parental cell lines are identified. The expression of SOX13/SCAF1 is manipulated in GC cell lines where relevant biological and molecular analyses are performed. Molecular docking and computational screening are performed to screen potential inhibitors of SOX13. We show that SOX13 boosts protein remodeling of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes by directly transactivating SCAF1. This leads to increased supercomplexes (SCs) assembly, mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial energetics and chemo- and immune-resistance. Zanamivir, reverts the ferroptosis-resistant phenotype via directly targeting SOX13 and promoting TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of SOX13. Here we show, SOX13/SCAF1 are important in ferroptosis-resistance, and targeting SOX13 with zanamivir has therapeutic potential.",

This cohort is prospectively analyzed using targeted sequencing to characterize subtype-specific somatic alterations in targetable pathways, rates of whole genome doubling, mutational signatures, and subtype-agnostic genomic clusters. The most common alterations are in cell cycle control and TP53, receptor tyrosine kinases/PI3K/RAS, and epigenetic regulators. Subtype-specific associations include TERT amplification in intimal sarcoma and SWI/SNF alterations in uterine adenosarcoma. Tumor mutational burden, while low compared to other cancers, varies between and within subtypes. This resource will improve sarcoma models, motivate studies of subtype-specific alterations, and inform investigations of genetic factors and their correlations with treatment response.",

Here we report our single arm phase II trial (NCT02693717) that assesses pemetrexed in MTAPdef urothelial carcinoma (UC) with the primary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR). Three of 7 enrolled MTAPdef patients show response to pemetrexed (ORR 43%). Furthermore, a historic cohort shows 4 of 4 MTAPdef patients respond to pemetrexed as compared to 1 of 10 MTAP-proficient patients. In vitro and in vivo preclinical data using UC cell lines demonstrate increased sensitivity to pemetrexed by inducing DNA damage, and distorting nucleotide pools. In addition, MTAP-knockdown increases sensitivity to pemetrexed. Furthermore, in a lung adenocarcinoma retrospective cohort (N = 72) from the published BATTLE2 clinical trial (NCT01248247), MTAPdef associates with an improved response rate to pemetrexed. Our data demonstrate a synthetic lethal interaction between MTAPdef and de novo purine inhibition, which represents a promising therapeutic strategy for larger prospective trials.",
Distinct genomic landscape of Chinese pediatric acute myeloid leukemia impacts clinical risk classification,"Ting Liu, Jianan Rao, Wenting Hu, Bowen Cui, Jiaoyang Cai, Yuhan Liu, Huiying Sun, Xiaoxiao Chen, Yanjing Tang, Jing Chen, Xiang Wang, Han Wang, Wubin Qian, Binchen Mao, Sheng Guo, Ronghua Wang, Yu Liu, Shuhong Shen",2022-03-28,"Studies have revealed key genomic aberrations in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on Western populations. It is unknown to what extent the current genomic findings represent populations with different ethnic backgrounds. Here we present the genomic landscape of driver alterations of Chinese pediatric AML and discover previously undescribed genomic aberrations, including the XPO1-TNRC18 fusion. Comprehensively comparing between the Chinese and Western AML cohorts reveal a substantially distinct genomic alteration profile. For example, Chinese AML patients more commonly exhibit mutations in KIT and CSF3R, and less frequently mutated of genes in the RAS signaling pathway. These differences in mutation frequencies lead to the detection of previously uncharacterized co-occurring mutation pairs. Importantly, the distinct driver profile is clinical relevant. We propose a refined prognosis risk classification model which better reflected the adverse event risk for Chinese AML patients. These results emphasize the importance of genetic background in precision medicine.",

In this study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03699332) we describe the results of a phase I clinical trial evaluating [111In]In-DOTA-labetuzumab-IRDye800CW, a dual-labeled anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (anti-CEA) antibody conjugate that enables both preoperative imaging and intraoperative radioguidance and fluorescence imaging. Primary study outcomes are safety and feasibility of this multimodal imaging approach. Secondary outcomes are determination of the optimal dose, correlation between tracer uptake and histopathology and effects on clinical strategy. Administration of [111In]In-DOTA-labetuzumab-IRDye800CW is well-tolerated and enables sensitive pre- and intraoperative imaging in patients who receive 10 or 50 mg of the tracer. Preoperative imaging revealed previously undetected lymph node metastases in one patient, and intraoperative fluorescence imaging revealed four previously undetected metastases in two patients. Alteration of clinical strategy based on multimodal imaging occurred in three patients. Thus, multimodal image-guided surgery after administration of this dual-labeled tracer is a promising approach that may aid in decision making before and during cytoreductive surgical procedures.",

We show undetectable humoral responses following two vaccine doses in 52% of patients undergoing active anticancer treatment. Moreover, 60% of patients on anti-CD20 therapy had undetectable antibodies following full vaccination within 12 months of receiving their anticancer therapy. However, 70% of individuals with indolent B-cell lymphoma displayed improved antibody responses following booster vaccination. Notably, 63% of all patients displayed antigen-specific T-cell responses, which increased after a third dose irrespective of their cancer treatment status.

Homophilic ATP1A1 binding induces activin A secretion to promote EMT of tumor cells and myofibroblast activation,"Yi-Ing Chen, Chin-Chun Chang, Min-Fen Hsu, Yung-Ming Jeng, Yu-Wen Tien, Ming-Chu Chang, Yu-Ting Chang, Chun-Mei Hu, Wen-Hwa Lee",2022-05-26,"Tumor cells with diverse phenotypes and biological behaviors are influenced by stromal cells through secretory factors or direct cell-cell contact. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by extensive desmoplasia with fibroblasts as the major cell type. In the present study, we observe enrichment of myofibroblasts in a juxta-tumoral position with tumor cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that facilitates invasion and correlates with a worse clinical prognosis in PDAC patients. Direct cell-cell contacts forming heterocellular aggregates between fibroblasts and tumor cells are detected in primary pancreatic tumors and circulating tumor microemboli (CTM). Mechanistically, ATP1A1 overexpressed in tumor cells binds to and reorganizes ATP1A1 of fibroblasts that induces calcium oscillations, NF-κB activation, and activin A secretion. Silencing ATP1A1 expression or neutralizing activin A secretion suppress tumor invasion and colonization. Taken together, these results elucidate the direct interplay between tumor cells and bound fibroblasts in PDAC progression, thereby providing potential therapeutic opportunities for inhibiting metastasis by interfering with these cell-cell interactions.",

We further establish a subtyping scheme based on the molecular features of malignant T cells and their pro-tumorigenic microenvironments: the TCyEM group, demonstrating a cytotoxic effector memory T cell phenotype, shows more M2 macrophages infiltration, while the TCM group, featured by a central memory T cell phenotype and adverse patient outcome, is infiltrated by highly exhausted CD8+ reactive T cells, B cells and Tregs with suppressive activities. Our results establish a solid basis for understanding the nature of CTCL and pave the way for future precision medicine for CTCL patients.",

Using a highly multiplex immunofluorescence and image analysis we generate spatial proteomic data for 21 markers in 124,623 single cells from 112 tumor cores originating from 31 tumors with BRCA1/2 mutation (BRCA1/2mut), and from 13 tumors without alterations in HR genes. We identify a phenotypically distinct tumor microenvironment in the BRCA1/2mut tumors with evidence of increased immunosurveillance. Importantly, we report a prognostic role of a proliferative tumor-cell subpopulation, which associates with enhanced spatial tumor-immune interactions by CD8+ and CD4 + T-cells in the BRCA1/2mut tumors. The single-cell spatial landscapes indicate distinct patterns of spatial immunosurveillance with the potential to improve immunotherapeutic strategies and patient stratification in HGSC.",

A prospective study comparing water only with positive oral contrast in patients undergoing abdominal CT scan,"Pascale A. M. de Wit, Jeroen A. W. Tielbeek, Pascal R. van Diepen, Ikrame Oulad Abdennabi, Ludo F. M. Beenen, Shandra Bipat",2020-04-22,"Consecutive adults scheduled to undergo abdominal CT with oral contrast were asked to choose between 1000 ml water only or positive oral contrast (50 ml Télébrix-Gastro diluted in 950 ml water). Two abdominal radiologists independently reviewed each scan for image quality of the abdomen, the diagnostic confidence per system (gastrointestinalsystem/organs/peritoneum/retroperitoneum/lymph nodes) and overall diagnostic confidence to address the clinical question (not able/partial able/fully able). Radiation exposure was extracted from dose reports. Differences between both groups were evaluated by Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney-U-test or chi-square-test. Of the 320participants, 233chose water only. All baseline characteristics, image quality of the abdomen and the diagnostic confidence of the organs were comparable between groups and both observers. Diagnostic confidence in the water only group was more commonly scored as less than good by observer1. The results were as follows: the gastrointestinal system(18/233vs1/87; p = 0.031), peritoneum (21/233vs1/87; p = 0.012), retroperitoneum (11/233vs0/87; p = 0.040) and lymph nodes (11/233vs0/87; p = 0.040). These structures were scored as comparable between both groups by observer2. The diagnostic confidence to address the clinical question could be partially addressed in 6/233 vs 0/87 patients (p = 0.259). The water only group showed a tendency towards less radiation exposure. In summary, most scan ratings were comparable between positive contrast and water only, but slightly favored positive oral contrast for one reader for some abdominal structures. Therefore, water only can replace positive oral contrast in the majority of the outpatients scheduled to undergo an abdominal CT.",
"Evolution of etiology, presentation, management and prognostic tool in hepatocellular carcinoma","Shu-Yein Ho, Po-Hong Liu, Chia-Yang Hsu, Cheng-Yuan Hsia, Yi-Hsiang Huang, Hao-Jan Lei, Chien-Wei Su, Rheun-Chuan Lee, Ming-Chih Hou, Teh-Ia Huo",2020-03-03,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its current status is unclear. We aimed to investigate the evolution of etiology, presentation, management and prognostic tool in HCC over the past 12 years. A total of 3349 newly diagnosed HCC patients were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. The comparison of survival was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. Hepatitis B and C virus infection in HCC were continuously declining over the three time periods (2004–2007, 2008–2011, 2012–2015; p < 0.001). At diagnosis, single tumor detection rate increased to 73% (p < 0.001), whereas vascular invasion gradually decreased to 20% in 2012–2015 (p < 0.001). Early stage HCC gradually increased from 2004–2007 to 2012–2015 (p < 0.001). The probability of patients receiving curative treatment and long-term survival increased from 2004–2007 to 2012–2015 (p < 0.001). The Cancer of Liver Italian Program (CLIP) and Taipei Integrated Scoring (TIS) system were two more accurate staging systems among all. In conclusion, the clinical presentations of HCC have significantly changed over the past 12 years. Hepatitis B and C virus-associated HCC became less common, and more patients were diagnosed at early cancer stage. Patient survival increased due to early cancer detection that results in increased probability to undergo curative therapies.",

Andersson, Niels Kroman",2024-04-13,"Most Western countries have increasing number of new cancer cases per year. Cancer incidence is primarily influenced by basically avoidable risk factors and an aging population. Through hypothetical elimination scenarios of multiple major risk factors for cancer, we estimated the number of new cancer cases that are non-preventable in 2050. We compare numbers of new postmenopausal breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer cases in 2021 to projected numbers of new cases in 2050 under prevention scenarios regarding smoking, overweight and obesity, and alcohol consumption: no intervention, 50%, and 100% instant reduction. Cancer incidence data were derived from NORDCAN, and risk factor prevalence data from the Danish National Health Survey. Cancer projections were calculated with the Prevent program. Hypothetical 100% instant elimination of major risk factors for cancer in Denmark in 2022 will result in unchanged numbers of new breast and colorectal cancers in 2050. The number of new prostate cancers will increase by 25% compared to 2021. Unchanged risk factor levels will result in noticeable increase in cancer burden. Increase in life expectancy and age will entail an increase in cancer incidence, despite maximum effect of preventive actions in the population. Our results are important when planning future health care.",

For the RP prediction models, 275 non-small-cell lung cancer patients consisted of 245 training (22 with grade ≥ 2 RP) and 30 test cases (8 with grade ≥ 2 RP) were selected. A total of 486 radiomic features were calculated to quantify the RP texture patterns reflecting radiation-induced tissue reaction within lung volumes irradiated with more than x Gy, which were defined as LVx. Ten subsets consisting of all 22 RP cases and 22 or 23 randomly selected non-RP cases were created from the imbalanced dataset of 245 training patients. For each subset, signatures were constructed, and predictive models were built using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression. An ensemble averaging model was built by averaging the RP probabilities of the 10 models. The best model areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) calculated on the training and test cohort for LV5 were 0.871 and 0.756, respectively. The radiomic features calculated on pretreatment planning CT images could be predictive imaging biomarkers for RP after lung cancer SBRT.",
Tumor infiltrating lymphocyte clusters are associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibition in BRAF V600E/K mutated malignant melanomas,"Sebastian Klein, Cornelia Mauch, Klaus Brinker, Ka-Won Noh, Sonja Knez, Reinhard Büttner, Alexander Quaas, Doris Helbig",2021-01-19,"Patients with metastasized malignant melanomas (MM) are regularly treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI). Within our study, we evaluated the predictive value of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) clusters in primary MM and its association to molecular subtypes to predict response to CPI treatment. A cohort of 90 MM patients who received CPI treatment were collected from a single center, as well as a validation cohort of 351 patients from the TCGA database (SKCM) who received standard of care. A deep-convolutional-neural network (U-Net) was trained to detect viable tumor areas on H&E whole-slide-images, following a quantitative detection of TILs with help of a separate additional neural network. The number of TIL clusters was associated with response to CPI in 90 MM patients (AUC = 0.6), even more pronounced within the sub-cohort of BRAF V600E/K-mutated MM patients (AUC = 0.7, n = 32). Interestingly, the TIL clusters in NRAS-mutated as well as wildtype MM (BRAF-wt, NRAS-wt) tumors, did not demonstrate a predictive value of CPI response (AUC = 0.5, n = 25). Moreover, PD-L1 expression had a limited predictive value within our cohort. In parallel, within an independent cohort of MM patients (TCGA, n = 351), the number of TIL clusters was associated with improved survival in BRAF V600E/K mutated MM (p < 0.0001, n = 164) but neither in NRAS-mutated (55.7 months vs. 63.0 months, respectively, p = 0.590, n = 85) nor BRAF/NRAS-wildtype MM patients (52.4 months vs. 47.4 months, respectively, p = 0.581, n = 104). While TILs in MM have been associated with improved survival, we show—for the first time—that TIL clusters are associated with response to immunotherapy in BRAF V600E/K mutated MM.",
The use of prostate specific antigen density to predict clinically significant prostate cancer,"Igor Yusim, Muhammad Krenawi, Elad Mazor, Victor Novack, Nicola J. Mabjeesh",2020-11-17,"The purpose of this study was to assess the predictive value of prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in men undergoing systematic transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy. We retrospectively analyzed data of men who underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy because of elevated PSA (≤ 20 ng/ml) or abnormal digital rectal examination. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to compare PSA and PSAD performance and chi-square automatic interaction detector methodologies were used to identify predictors of clinically significant cancer (Gleason score ≥ 7 or international society of urological pathology grade group ≥ 2). Nine-hundred and ninety-two consecutive men with a median age of 66 years (IQR 61–71) were included in the study. Median PSAD was 0.10 ng/ml2 (IQR 0.10–0.22). Prostate adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 338 men (34%). Clinically significant prostate adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 167 patients (50% of all cancers and 17% of the whole cohort). The AUC to predict clinically significant prostate cancer was 0.64 for PSA and 0.78 for PSAD (P < 0.001). The highest Youden's index for PSAD was at 0.20 ng/ml2 with 70% sensitivity and 79% specificity for the diagnosis of clinically significant cancer. Men with PSAD < 0.09 ng/ml2 had only 4% chance of having clinically significant disease. The detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSAD between 0.09 and 0.19 ng/ml2 was significantly higher when prostate volume was less than 33 ml. In conclusion, PSAD was a better predictor than PSA alone of clinically significant prostate cancer in patients undergoing TRUS-guided biopsy. Patients with PSAD below 0.09 ng/ml2 were unlikely to harbor clinically significant prostate cancer. Combining PSAD in the gray zone (0.09–0.19) with prostate volume below 33 ml adds diagnostic value of clinically significant prostate cancer.",

Then, we focused on a pilot case of prostate cancer with multiple metastases for genetic analyses. Whole-exome sequencing of post-mortem plasma-derived cell-free DNA and eight frozen metastatic cancer tissues collected during rapid autopsy was performed, and compared their mutational statuses. The post-mortem plasma cell-free DNA was successfully sequenced and 344 mutations were identified. Of these, 160 were detected in at least one of the metastases. Further, 99% of the mutations shared by all metastases were present in the plasma. Sanger sequencing of 30 additional formalin-fixed metastases enabled us to map the clones harboring mutations initially detected only in the plasma. In conclusion, post-mortem blood, which is usually disposed of during conventional autopsies, can provide valuable data if sequenced in detail, especially regarding cancer heterogeneity. Furthermore, post-mortem plasma cell-free DNA sequencing (liquid autopsy) can be a novel platform for cancer research and a tool for genomic pathology.",
A paradigm shift in diagnosis and treatment innovation for mucinous cystic neoplasms of the liver,"Bin Shi, Peng Yu, Lingzhan Meng, Hu Li, Zizheng Wang, Li Cao, Jin Yan, Yanling Shao, Ying Zhang, Zhenyu Zhu",2024-07-17,"This study comprehensively explores the clinical characteristics, diagnostic approaches, and treatment methods for liver mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN). A retrospective analysis was conducted on seven individuals diagnosed with MCN, admitted to the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital between October 2016 and May 2023. Preoperative AFP was negative, while CA19-9 was elevated in two cases. Surgical resection was performed for all patients. The patients showed favorable postoperative recovery. Follow-up revealed an excellent overall survival rate, except for one case of invasive carcinoma resulting in tumor recurrence and metastasis 6 months after surgery. MCN poses a diagnostic challenge due to the absence of distinct clinical and radiological features, leading to potential misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Patients with suspected liver cystic diseases should consider the possibility of MCN. Surgical resection has proven to be a practical approach with satisfactory therapeutic outcomes.","Mucinous cystic neoplasms, Invasive carcinoma, Liver, Diagnosis, Treatment, Surgical resection"

Huntsman, William D. Foulkes, Yemin Wang, Sidong Huang",2023-05-20,"SMARCA4 (BRG1) and SMARCA2 (BRM) are the two paralogous ATPases of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes frequently inactivated in cancers. Cells deficient in either ATPase have been shown to depend on the remaining counterpart for survival. Contrary to this paralog synthetic lethality, concomitant loss of SMARCA4/2 occurs in a subset of cancers associated with very poor outcomes. Here, we uncover that SMARCA4/2-loss represses expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, causing reduced glucose uptake and glycolysis accompanied with increased dependency on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS); adapting to this, these SMARCA4/2-deficient cells rely on elevated SLC38A2, an amino acid transporter, to increase glutamine import for fueling OXPHOS. Consequently, SMARCA4/2-deficient cells and tumors are highly sensitive to inhibitors targeting OXPHOS or glutamine metabolism. Furthermore, supplementation of alanine, also imported by SLC38A2, restricts glutamine uptake through competition and selectively induces death in SMARCA4/2-deficient cancer cells. At a clinically relevant dose, alanine supplementation synergizes with OXPHOS inhibition or conventional chemotherapy eliciting marked antitumor activity in patient-derived xenografts. Our findings reveal multiple druggable vulnerabilities of SMARCA4/2-loss exploiting a GLUT1/SLC38A2-mediated metabolic shift. Particularly, unlike dietary deprivation approaches, alanine supplementation can be readily applied to current regimens for better treatment of these aggressive cancers.",
Targeting TSPEAR-AS2 suppresses tumor growth and interferon signaling in esophageal cancer,"Chunyan Zhang, Yuanbo Cui",2024-11-20,"Dysregulation of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and interferon signaling contributes to tumorigenesis and progression; however, their crosstalk in tumor biology remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that TSPEAR-AS2, an lncRNA mediated by METTL1, activates the interferon signaling pathway in esophageal cancer (ESCA). Clinically, we conducted a pan-cancer investigation and identified TSPEAR-AS2 as a novel ESCA-related lncRNA that predicts a worse patient prognosis. The high expression of TSPEAR-AS2 was validated in multiple ESCA cohorts, demonstrating that this lncRNA had good diagnostic performance. METTL1, an RNA N7-methylguanosine (m7G) methyltransferase, was positively correlated with TSPEAR-AS2 expression in ESCA tissues, and METTL1 was found to induce TSPEAR-AS2 expression in ESCA cells. Functionally, the up-regulation of TSPEAR-AS2 promoted proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and stemness in ESCA cells, whereas its knockdown attenuated these malignant phenotypes. Furthermore, both TSPEAR-AS2 deficiency and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based intratumoral intervention could significantly suppress tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that TSPEAR-AS2 ablation altered the expression of functional proteins related to interferon signaling pathways, such as HLA-E, IRF3, and IFITs. These findings identify a previously unrecognized role of the METTL1/TSPEAR-AS2/interferon signaling axis in ESCA development and suggest that TSPEAR-AS2 is a potential prognostic indicator and therapeutic vulnerability for this malignancy.","Esophageal cancer, TSPEAR-AS2, METTL1, Interferon signaling, Stemness"
Tissue-specific thresholds of mutation burden associated with anti-PD-1/L1 therapy benefit and prognosis in microsatellite-stable cancers,"Maishara Muquith, Magdalena Espinoza, Andrew Elliott, Joanne Xiu, Andreas Seeber, Wafik El-Deiry, Emmanuel S.

Tumor mutation burden (TMB) is postulated to be a generic determinant of ICI-dependent tumor rejection. Here we describe the association between TMB and survival outcomes among microsatellite-stable cancers in a real-world clinicogenomic cohort consisting of 70,698 patients distributed across 27 histologies. TMB was associated with survival benefit or detriment depending on tissue and treatment context, with eight cancer types demonstrating a specific association between TMB and improved outcomes upon treatment with anti-PD-1/L1 therapies. Survival benefits were noted over a broad range of TMB cutoffs across cancer types, and a dose-dependent relationship between TMB and outcomes was observed in a subset of cancers. These results have implications for the use of cancer-agnostic and universal TMB cutoffs to guide the use of anti-PD-1/L1 therapies, and they underline the importance of tissue context in the development of ICI biomarkers.",
Accurate patient alignment without unnecessary imaging using patient-specific 3D CT images synthesized from 2D kV images,"Yuzhen Ding, Jason M. Holmes, Hongying Feng, Baoxin Li, Lisa A. McGee, Jean-Claude M. Rwigema, Sujay A. Vora, William W. Wong, Daniel J. Ma, Robert L. Foote, Samir H. Patel, Wei Liu",2024-11-21,"BackgroundIn radiotherapy, 2D orthogonally projected kV images are used for patient alignment when 3D-on-board imaging (OBI) is unavailable. However, tumor visibility is constrained due to the projection of patient’s anatomy onto a 2D plane, potentially leading to substantial setup errors. In treatment room with 3D-OBI such as cone beam CT (CBCT), the field of view (FOV) of CBCT is limited with unnecessarily high imaging dose. A solution to this dilemma is to reconstruct 3D CT from kV images obtained at the treatment position.MethodsWe propose a dual-models framework built with hierarchical ViT blocks. Unlike a proof-of-concept approach, our framework considers kV images acquired by 2D imaging devices in the treatment room as the solo input and can synthesize accurate, full-size 3D CT within milliseconds.ResultsWe demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach on 10 patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer using image quality (MAE: < 45HU), dosimetric accuracy (Gamma passing rate ((2%/2 mm/10%): > 97%) and patient position uncertainty (shift error: < 0.4 mm).ConclusionsThe proposed framework can generate accurate 3D CT faithfully mirroring patient position effectively, thus substantially improving patient setup accuracy, keeping imaging dose minimal, and maintaining treatment veracity.",
Skin basal cell carcinomas assemble a pro-tumorigenic spatially organized and self-propagating Trem2+ myeloid niche,"Daniel Haensel, Bence Daniel, Sadhana Gaddam, Cory Pan, Tania Fabo, Jeremy Bjelajac, Anna R. Jussila, Fernanda Gonzalez, Nancy Yanzhe Li, Yun Chen, JinChao Hou, Tiffany Patel, Sumaira Aasi, Ansuman T. Satpathy, Anthony E. Oro",2023-05-10,"Cancer immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment but have shown limited success as single-agent therapies highlighting the need to understand the origin, assembly, and dynamics of heterogeneous tumor immune niches. Here, we use single-cell and imaging-based spatial analysis to elucidate three microenvironmental neighborhoods surrounding the heterogeneous basal cell carcinoma tumor epithelia. Within the highly proliferative neighborhood, we find that TREM2+ skin cancer-associated macrophages (SCAMs) support the proliferation of a distinct tumor epithelial population through an immunosuppression-independent manner via oncostatin-M/JAK-STAT3 signaling. SCAMs represent a unique tumor-specific TREM2+ population defined by VCAM1 surface expression that is not found in normal homeostatic skin or during wound healing. Furthermore, SCAMs actively proliferate and self-propagate through multiple serial tumor passages, indicating long-term potential. The tumor rapidly drives SCAM differentiation, with intratumoral injections sufficient to instruct naive bone marrow-derived monocytes to polarize within days. This work provides mechanistic insights into direct tumor-immune niche dynamics independent of immunosuppression, providing the basis for potential combination tumor therapies.",
Predicting response to enzalutamide and abiraterone in metastatic prostate cancer using whole-omics machine learning,"Anouk C. de Jong, Alexandra Danyi, Job van Riet, Ronald de Wit, Martin Sjöström, Felix Feng, Jeroen de Ridder, Martijn P. Lolkema",2023-04-08,"Response to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) varies widely in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To improve treatment guidance, biomarkers are needed. We use whole-genomics (WGS; n = 155) with matching whole-transcriptomics (WTS; n = 113) from biopsies of ARSI-treated mCRPC patients for unbiased discovery of biomarkers and development of machine learning-based prediction models. Tumor mutational burden (q < 0.001), structural variants (q < 0.05), tandem duplications (q < 0.05) and deletions (q < 0.05) are enriched in poor responders, coupled with distinct transcriptomic expression profiles. Validating various classification models predicting treatment duration with ARSI on our internal and external mCRPC cohort reveals two best-performing models, based on the combination of prior treatment information with either the four combined enriched genomic markers or with overall transcriptomic profiles. In conclusion, predictive models combining genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data can predict response to ARSI in mCRPC patients and, with additional optimization and prospective validation, could improve treatment guidance.",

Green, Weiping Zou, Arul M. Chinnaiyan",2024-06-28,"Cancer treatment continues to shift from utilizing traditional therapies to targeted ones, such as protein kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy. Mobilizing dendritic cells (DC) and other myeloid cells with antigen presenting and cancer cell killing capacities is an attractive but not fully exploited approach. Here, we show that PIKFYVE is a shared gene target of clinically relevant protein kinase inhibitors and high expression of this gene in DCs is associated with poor patient response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Genetic and pharmacological studies demonstrate that PIKfyve ablation enhances the function of CD11c+ cells (predominantly dendritic cells) via selectively altering the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. Both loss of Pikfyve in CD11c+ cells and treatment with apilimod, a potent and specific PIKfyve inhibitor, restrained tumor growth, enhanced DC-dependent T cell immunity, and potentiated ICB efficacy in tumor-bearing mouse models. Furthermore, the combination of a vaccine adjuvant and apilimod reduced tumor progression in vivo. Thus, PIKfyve negatively regulates the function of CD11c+ cells, and PIKfyve inhibition has promise for cancer immunotherapy and vaccine treatment strategies.",
Development and validation of a predictive model based on β-Klotho for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"XiangXiu Wang, HongWei Liu, Gang Wu, Yan Lu, Ying Cui",2024-07-24,"Head and neck epithelial tissue tumors may be identified as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). Numerous malignancies are encouraged by dysregulation of the FGF19-β-Klotho (KLB) axis in the tumor microenvironment. Using protein databases and RT-qPCR, we examined KLB expression in HNSC. In HNSC, higher KLB expression was linked to longer survival times and better prognoses. Furthermore, variations in drug susceptibility and immunological infiltration were noted according to KLB expression levels. These results underscore the importance of KLB in the course and management of HNSC by indicating that it may function as a possible prognostic marker and influence immunological and therapeutic responses in these individuals. Further study on HNSC is necessary to investigate KLB's potential as a therapeutic target and prognostic indicator.",
Enhancing localized chemotherapy with anti-angiogenesis and nanomedicine synergy for improved tumor penetration in well-vascularized tumors,"Mohammad Souri, Sohail Elahi, Farshad Moradi Kashkooli, Mohammad Kohandel, M. Soltani",2024-11-20,"Intratumoral delivery and localized chemotherapy have demonstrated promise in tumor treatment; however, the rapid drainage of therapeutic agents from well-vascularized tumors limits their ability to achieve maximum therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, innovative approaches are needed to enhance treatment efficacy in such tumors. This study utilizes a mathematical modeling platform to assess the efficacy of combination therapy using anti-angiogenic drugs and drug-loaded nanoparticles. Anti-angiogenic drugs are included to reduce blood microvascular density and facilitate drug retention in the extracellular space. In addition, incorporating negatively charged nanoparticles aims to enhance diffusion and distribution of therapeutic agents within well-vascularized tumors. The findings indicate that, in the case of direct injection of free drugs, using compounds with lower drainage rates and higher diffusion coefficients is beneficial for achieving broader diffusion. Otherwise, drugs tend to accumulate primarily around the injection site. For instance, the drug doxorubicin, known for its rapid drainage, requires the prior direct injection of an anti-angiogenic drug with a high diffusion rate to reduce microvascular density and facilitate broader distribution, enhancing penetration depth by 200%. Moreover, the results demonstrate that negatively charged nanoparticles effectively disperse throughout the tissue due to their high diffusion coefficient. In addition, a faster drug release rate from nanoparticles further enhance treatment efficacy, achieving the necessary concentration for complete eradication of tumor compared to slower drug release rates. This study demonstrates the potential of utilizing negatively charged nanoparticles loaded with chemotherapy drugs exhibiting high release rates for localized chemotherapy through intratumoral injection in well-vascularized tumors.",
Cell surface marker heterogeneity in human myeloma cell lines for modeling of disease and therapy,"Alenka Djarmila Behsen, Toril Holien, Francesca Micci, Morten Rye, Jenny Malm Rasmussen, Kristin Andersen, Eli Svorkdal Hess, Magne Børset, Jonathan Keats, Thea Kristin Våtsveen, Kristine Misund",2024-11-20,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy originating from plasma cells. Genetically, MM is categorized into two subtypes: hyperdiploid and non-hyperdiploid tumors, with distinct chromosomal characteristics. Human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) are instrumental in understanding MM and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their utility depends on their resemblance to patient-derived cells. We analyzed protein expression of cell surface markers, including myeloma drug targets and immunotherapy-relevant markers, in nine HMCLs using flow cytometry. RNAseq analysis was performed to correlate protein expression with transcriptomic data. While five cell surface markers (CD47, CD49d, CD138, CD269 (BCMA), and GPRC5D) were highly expressed and three (CD19, CD20, and CD117) were low or negative across cell lines, heterogenous expression was observed for the 16 remaining markers. A comparative study with patient-derived transcriptomic data indicated that four of our six in-house HMCLs closely resembled patient disease. Furthermore, our hyperdiploid HMCLs correlated better with hyperdiploid than non-hyperdiploid patient samples. Here, we also describe three previously uncharacterized HMCLs; IH-1, URVIN and FOLE. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating surface protein expression in HMCLs when modeling MM. The observed variations in expression levels emphasize the need for a strategic selection of cell lines based on the study’s objectives.",
Methionine deprivation inhibits glioma proliferation and EMT via the TP53TG1/miR-96-5p/STK17B ceRNA pathway,"Jiafeng Li, Ruijie Liu, Hong Hu, Yishuai Huang, Ying Shi, Honglei Li, Hao Chen, Meng Cai, Ning Wang, Tao Yan, Kaikai Wang, Huailei Liu",2024-11-21,"Recent research highlights the significant impact of methionine metabolism on glioma progression. An increasing amount of compelling evidence bridges long non-coding RNAs to abnormal metabolism in gliomas. However, the specific role of long non-coding RNAs in methionine metabolism regulating glioma progression remains unclear. This study reveals that methionine deprivation inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion capabilities of gliomas. Interestingly, the expression of TP53TG1, a long non-coding RNA, is also suppressed. TP53TG1 is highly expressed in gliomas and associated with poor patient outcomes. Subsequently, our data proves that inhibition of TP53TG1 suppresses glioma cell proliferation and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process both in vitro and in vivo. Ultimately, we found that the underlying mechanism involves a competing endogenous RNA regulating network, in which TP53TG1 modulates the target protein STK17B by competitively binding to miR-96-5p, thus regulating glioma progression. These findings suggest that targeting methionine deprivation could be a promising approach for the clinical treatment of glioma.",
Research on the mean maximum Young’s modulus value as a new diagnostic parameter for prostate cancer,"Jieyu Duan, ZhanHui Liu, Zhong Li, Haoyu Wang, Wei Zhao",2024-07-22,"Ultrasound-based shear wave elastography (SWE) can non-invasively assess prostate tissue stiffness for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). So far, there is no widely recognized standard for the detection process and calculation method of Young’s modulus value in transrectal SWE ultrasound imaging (TSWEUI). In our study, the mean maximum Young’s modulus value (m-Emax) of the maximum cross-section of prostate is obtained by calculating the mean of 12 measured Emax in the four quadrants. This retrospective study included 209 suspected malignant prostate disease patients with pathological results in our hospital. Among the 209 patients, 75 patients completed TSWEUI, and 63 of the 75 patients completed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 75 patients for m-Emax was 0.754. The prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen, and m-Emax were used to develop a nomogram (AUC = 0.868). The nomogram could effectively predict the probability of PCa, thereby reducing the needle biopsy rate for diagnosing PCa. The AUC of 63 patients was not statistically different between m-Emax (AUC = 0.717) and MRI (AUC = 0.787) (P = 0.361). These indicate that m-Emax can be used as an innovative parameter in TSWEUI to diagnosis PCa. TSWEUI is more cost-effective than MRI in diagnosing PCa.","Diagnosis, Magnetic resonance imaging, Prostate cancer, Shear wave elastography, Ultrasound, Young’s modulus value"

In the study TNBC patients who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and surgery were analyzed retrospectively. The primary aim of the study was to analyze the impact of Her2 status(Her2-0 and Her2-low) on pathological complete response (pCR). The secondary objectives were disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). 620 female triple negative breast cancer patients were evaluated. 427 patients (68.9%) had Her2-0 and 193(31.1%) had her2-low pathology. The pCR rates were similar between Her2-0 and Her2-low patients (33.0% vs. 27.5%, p = 0.098).

We therefore focused on the role played by CD34 + hematopoietic stem cells (PBSC) harvesting and reinfusion on toxicity and outcome. Overall, 90% (n = 245) of enrolled patients who underwent the first leukapheresis collected ≥ 4 × 106 PBSC/kg, 2.6% (n = 7) mobilized < 4 × 106 PBSC/kg and 7.7% (n = 21) failed the collection. Similar results were obtained for the planned second leukapheresis, with only one patient failing both attempts. Median count of reinfused PBSC was 5 × 106/kg and median time to recovery from neutropenia G4 was 10 days from ASCT. No impact of mobilizing subtype or number of reinfused PBSC on hematological recovery and LEN dose reduction was noted. At a median follow-up of 75 months from ASCT, PFS and OS of transplanted patients were 50% and 73%, respectively. A long lasting G4 neutropenia after ASCT (> 10 days) was associated with a worse outcome, both in terms of PFS and OS. In conclusion, although the harvesting procedures proved feasible for younger MCL patients, long-lasting cytopenia following ASCT remains a significant issue: this can hinder the administration of effective maintenance therapies, potentially increasing the relapse rate and negatively affecting survival outcomes.","Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), Leukapheresis (LK), Hematological recovery"
Targeting C/EBPα overcomes primary resistance and improves the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors in acute myeloid leukaemia,"Hanlin Wang, Guanghao Luo, Xiaobei Hu, Gaoya Xu, Tao Wang, Minmin Liu, Xiaohui Qiu, Jianan Li, Jingfeng Fu, Bo Feng, Yutong Tu, Weijuan Kan, Chang Wang, Ran Xu, Yubo Zhou, Jianmin Yang, Jia Li",2023-04-05,"The outcomes of FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) have been improved since the approval of FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i). However, approximately 30-50% of patients exhibit primary resistance (PR) to FLT3i with poorly defined mechanisms, posing a pressing clinical unmet need. Here, we identify C/EBPα activation as a top PR feature by analyzing data from primary AML patient samples in Vizome. C/EBPα activation limit FLT3i efficacy, while its inactivation synergistically enhances FLT3i action in cellular and female animal models. We then perform an in silico screen and identify that guanfacine, an antihypertensive medication, mimics C/EBPα inactivation. Furthermore, guanfacine exerts a synergistic effect with FLT3i in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we ascertain the role of C/EBPα activation in PR in an independent cohort of FLT3-ITD patients. These findings highlight C/EBPα activation as a targetable PR mechanism and support clinical studies aimed at testing the combination of guanfacine with FLT3i in overcoming PR and enhancing the efficacy of FLT3i therapy.",

Here, we investigate the association of antimicrobial exposure and peripheral lymphocyte count during TNBC treatment with survival, using integrated electronic medical record and California Cancer Registry data in the Oncoshare database. Of 772 women with stage I-III TNBC treated with and without standard cytotoxic chemotherapy – prior to the immune checkpoint inhibitor era – most (654, 85%) used antimicrobials. Applying multivariate analyses, we show that each additional total or unique monthly antimicrobial prescription is associated with inferior overall and breast cancer-specific survival. This antimicrobial-mortality association is independent of changes in neutrophil count, is unrelated to disease severity, and is sustained through year three following diagnosis, suggesting antimicrobial exposure negatively impacts TNBC survival. These results may inform mechanistic studies and antimicrobial prescribing decisions in TNBC and other hormone receptor-independent cancers.",

MYC oncoprotein is elevated in G3 MB tumors; however, the mechanisms that support MYC abundance remain unclear. Using metabolic and mechanistic profiling, we pinpoint a role for mitochondrial metabolism in regulating MYC. Complex-I inhibition decreases MYC abundance in G3 MB, attenuates the expression of MYC-downstream targets, induces differentiation, and prolongs male animal survival. Mechanistically, complex-I inhibition increases inactivating acetylation of antioxidant enzyme SOD2 at K68 and K122, triggering the accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species that promotes MYC oxidation and degradation in a mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-dependent manner. MPC inhibition blocks the acetylation of SOD2 and oxidation of MYC, restoring MYC abundance and self-renewal capacity in G3 MB cells following complex-I inhibition. Identification of this MPC-SOD2 signaling axis reveals a role for metabolism in regulating MYC protein abundance that has clinical implications for treating G3 MB.",
A novel model using leukocytes to differentiating mild autonomous cortisol secretion and non-functioning adrenal adenoma,"Xin Zhao, Jiaquan Zhou, Xiaohong Lyu, Yanan Li, Lin Ma, Yihong Liu, Hua Fan, Yushi Zhang",2024-10-09,"BackgroundMild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS) accounts for a significant proportion of adrenal incidentaloma. Current endocrinological screening tests for MACS are complex, particularly in areas with limited medical resources. This study aimed to develop a diagnostic tool based on leukocyte-related parameters to differentiate between MACS and non-functioning adrenal adenoma (NFA).MethodsInthis retrospective case-control study, propensity score-matching was used to select 567 patients from a cohort of 1108 patients (201 MACS, 907 NFA). External validation cohort included 52MACS and 48 NFA from two hospitals, which did not overlap with the modeling cohort patients. Leukocyte-related parameters were evaluated, and the diagnostic efficacy of each parameter was assessed by calculating Youden’s J index (J) and the area under the curve (AUC). The study population was divided into training and testing samples using a 10-fold cross-validation method. Machine learning (ML) and classification and regression tree (CART) model were established.ResultsAfter propensity score matching, 567 patients were enrolled, including 197 MACS and 370 NFA. With the exception of basophil percentage, all other parameters differed significantly between the two groups. Lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage, eosinophils count, eosinophils percentage, and basophil percentage were lower in the MACS group compared to the NFA group. Eosinophils percentage demonstrated the highest AUC (0.650), with a sensitivity of 51.3% and specificity of 73.2%. The ML model, based on multiple parameters,exhibited better performance in diagnosing MACS (sensitivity 76%, specificity 77.4%, and AUC 0.818). A clinically usable CART model achieved an AUC of 0.872, with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 75.7%.  In the validation cohort, the prediction accuracy of the ML model and the CART model were 0.784 and 0.798, respectively.ConclusionTheCART diagnostic model, constructed based on leukocyte-related parameters, could assist clinicians in distinguishing between MACS and NFA.","Mild autonomous cortisol secretion, Nonfunctioning adenomas, Diagnosis model, White blood counts, Leukocyte-related parameters"

Predicting the postoperative progression of PSBC can aid in the development of individualized treatment plans to improve patients’ progression-free survival (PFS) after surgery. This study aimed to develop a multiparametric MRI-based fusion radiomic model (FRM) and clinicoradiomic model (CRM) via radiomic and clinical analysis and to explore their validity in predicting postoperative progression in PSBC patients before surgery. In this retrospective study, a total of 129 patients with PSBC from our institution, including 57 patients with progression, were enrolled and randomized to the training set  (TS) or the validation set (VS) at a 2:1 ratio. Radiomic features were extracted and dimensionally reduced from 3.0 T/axial T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI) sequences for each patient, and the features were used for radiomic analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to screen for key clinical factors. We constructed models on the basis of multivariate logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analyses were performed to evaluate the performance of the clinical model (CM), FRM and CRM. Through analysis, we found that blood supply was the only significantly different clinical factor in the CM. For the FRM, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the TS was 0.925, and the calibration curves were consistent across the TS. In the CRM, the AUC of the TS was 0.929, the calibration curve analysis was consistent for both the TS and the VS, and the DCA showed that the net benefit was greater at a threshold probability of > 0% for both the TS and the VS. Our proposed FRM can help clinicians better predict PSBC progression preoperatively, and the use of the CRM can lead to the development of more appropriate protocols to improve patients’ PFS after surgery.","Fusion radiomic model (FRM), Clinicoradiomic model (CRM), Primary skull base chordoma (PSBC), Progression, Multiparametric MRI"

Turner",2021-04-23,"The genomics of advanced breast cancer (ABC) has been described through tumour tissue biopsy sequencing, although these approaches are limited by geographical and temporal heterogeneity. Here we use plasma circulating tumour DNA sequencing to interrogate the genomic profile of ABC in 800 patients in the plasmaMATCH trial. We demonstrate diverse subclonal resistance mutations, including enrichment of HER2 mutations in HER2 positive disease, co-occurring ESR1 and MAP kinase pathway mutations in HR + HER2− disease that associate with poor overall survival (p = 0.0092), and multiple PIK3CA mutations in HR + disease that associate with short progression free survival on fulvestrant (p = 0.0036). The fraction of cancer with a mutation, the clonal dominance of a mutation, varied between genes, and within hotspot mutations of ESR1 and PIK3CA. In ER-positive breast cancer subclonal mutations were enriched in an APOBEC mutational signature, with second hit PIK3CA mutations acquired subclonally and at sites characteristic of APOBEC mutagenesis. This study utilises circulating tumour DNA analysis in a large clinical trial to demonstrate the subclonal diversification of pre-treated advanced breast cancer, identifying distinct mutational processes in advanced ER-positive breast cancer, and novel therapeutic opportunities.",
Histopathologic image–based deep learning classifier for predicting platinum-based treatment responses in high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"Byungsoo Ahn, Damin Moon, Hyun-Soo Kim, Chung Lee, Nam Hoon Cho, Heung-Kook Choi, Dongmin Kim, Jung-Yun Lee, Eun Ji Nam, Dongju Won, Hee Jung An, Sun Young Kwon, Su-Jin Shin, Hye Ra Jung, Dohee Kwon, Heejung Park, Milim Kim, Yoon Jin Cha, Hyunjin Park, Yangkyu Lee, Songmi Noh, Yong-Moon Lee, Sung-Eun Choi, Ji Min Kim, Sun Hee Sung, Eunhyang Park",2024-05-18,"Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for female high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), but choosing an appropriate treatment for patients hinges on their responsiveness to it. Currently, no available biomarkers can promptly predict responses to platinum-based treatment. Therefore, we developed the Pathologic Risk Classifier for HGSOC (PathoRiCH), a histopathologic image–based classifier. PathoRiCH was trained on an in-house cohort (n = 394) and validated on two independent external cohorts (n = 284 and n = 136). The PathoRiCH-predicted favorable and poor response groups show significantly different platinum-free intervals in all three cohorts. Combining PathoRiCH with molecular biomarkers provides an even more powerful tool for the risk stratification of patients. The decisions of PathoRiCH are explained through visualization and a transcriptomic analysis, which bolster the reliability of our model’s decisions. PathoRiCH exhibits better predictive performance than current molecular biomarkers. PathoRiCH will provide a solid foundation for developing an innovative tool to transform the current diagnostic pipeline for HGSOC.",

In this study, we characterize the immune contexture of invasive lung ADC and its precursors by transcriptomic immune profiling, T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF). Our results demonstrate that anti-tumor immunity evolved as a continuum from lung preneoplasia, to preinvasive ADC, minimally-invasive ADC and frankly invasive lung ADC with a gradually less effective and more intensively regulated immune response including down-regulation of immune-activation pathways, up-regulation of immunosuppressive pathways, lower infiltration of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and anti-tumor helper T cells (Th), higher infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs), decreased T cell clonality, and lower frequencies of top T cell clones in later-stages. Driver mutations, chromosomal copy number aberrations (CNAs) and aberrant DNA methylation may collectively impinge host immune responses and facilitate immune evasion, promoting the outgrowth of fit subclones in preneoplasia into dominant clones in invasive ADC.",
A microRNA panel compared to environmental and polygenic scores for colorectal cancer risk prediction,"Janhavi R.

Here, we derive a blood-based miRNA panel and evaluate its ability to predict CRC occurrence in a population-based cohort of adults aged 50–75 years. Forty-one miRNAs are preselected from independent studies and measured by quantitative-real-time-polymerase-chain-reaction in serum collected at baseline of 198 participants who develop CRC during 14 years of follow-up and 178 randomly selected controls. A 7-miRNA score is derived by logistic regression. Its predictive ability, quantified by the optimism-corrected area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic-curve (AUC) using .632+ bootstrap is 0.794. Predictive ability is compared to that of an environmental risk score (ERS) based on known risk factors and a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on 140 previously identified single-nucleotide-polymorphisms. In participants with all scores available, optimism-corrected-AUC is 0.802 for the 7-miRNA score, while AUC (95% CI) is 0.557 (0.498–0.616) for the ERS and 0.622 (0.564–0.681) for the PRS.",
STING enhances cell death through regulation of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage,"Thomas J.

Rimm, Joseph N. Contessa",2021-04-19,"Resistance to DNA-damaging agents is a significant cause of treatment failure and poor outcomes in oncology. To identify unrecognized regulators of cell survival we performed a whole-genome CRISPR-Cas9 screen using treatment with ionizing radiation as a selective pressure, and identified STING (stimulator of interferon genes) as an intrinsic regulator of tumor cell survival. We show that STING regulates a transcriptional program that controls the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and that STING loss alters ROS homeostasis to reduce DNA damage and to cause therapeutic resistance. In agreement with these data, analysis of tumors from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patient specimens show that low STING expression is associated with worse outcomes. We also demonstrate that pharmacologic activation of STING enhances the effects of ionizing radiation in vivo, providing a rationale for therapeutic combinations of STING agonists and DNA-damaging agents. These results highlight a role for STING that is beyond its canonical function in cyclic dinucleotide and DNA damage sensing, and identify STING as a regulator of cellular ROS homeostasis and tumor cell susceptibility to reactive oxygen dependent, DNA damaging agents.",
Notch signaling and efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in relapsed small cell lung cancer,"Nitin Roper, Moises J. Velez, Alberto Chiappori, Yoo Sun Kim, Jun S.

To identify predictors of clinical benefit to ICB, we performed immunogenomic profiling of tumor samples from patients with relapsed SCLC. Tumors of patients who derive clinical benefit from ICB exhibit cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, high expression of antigen processing and presentation machinery (APM) genes, and low neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation. However, elevated Notch signaling, which positively correlates with low NE differentiation, most significantly predicts clinical benefit to ICB. Activation of Notch signaling in a NE human SCLC cell line induces a low NE phenotype, marked by increased expression of APM genes, demonstrating a mechanistic link between Notch activation, low NE differentiation and increased intrinsic tumor immunity. Our findings suggest Notch signaling as a determinant of response to ICB in SCLC.",

Primary endpoints were safety, dose finding, and pharmacokinetics in S1; safety and dose finding in S2. Secondary endpoints were anti-tumour activity (including overall response rate, ORR) and pharmacodynamics in S1; anti-tumour activity, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in S2. S1 and S2 enrolled a total of 149 and 228 patients, respectively. Grade ≥3 cibisatamab-related adverse events occurred in 36% of S1 and 49% of S2 patients. The ORR was 4% in S1 and 7% in S2. In S2, patients with microsatellite stable colorectal carcinoma (MSS-CRC) given flat doses of cibisatamab and atezolizumab demonstrated an ORR of 14%. In S1 and S2, 40% and 52% of patients, respectively, developed persistent anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). ADA appearance could be mitigated by obinutuzumab-pretreatment, with 8% of patients having persistent ADAs. Overall, cibisatamab warrants further exploration in immunotherapy combination strategies for MSS-CRC.",
Hsc70 promotes anti-tumor immunity by targeting PD-L1 for lysosomal degradation,"Xiaoyan Xu, Tingxue Xie, Mengxin Zhou, Yaqin Sun, Fengqi Wang, Yanan Tian, Ziyan Chen, Yanqi Xie, Ronghai Wu, Xufeng Cen, Jichun Zhou, Tingjun Hou, Lei Zhang, Chaoyang Huang, Qingwei Zhao, Dongrui Wang, Hongguang Xia",2024-05-18,"Immune checkpoint inhibition targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has become a powerful clinical strategy for treating cancer, but its efficacy is complicated by various resistance mechanisms. One of the reasons for the resistance is the internalization and recycling of PD-L1 itself upon antibody binding. The inhibition of lysosome-mediated degradation of PD-L1 is critical for preserving the amount of PD-L1 recycling back to the cell membrane. In this study, we find that Hsc70 promotes PD-L1 degradation through the endosome-lysosome pathway and reduces PD-L1 recycling to the cell membrane. This effect is dependent on Hsc70-PD-L1 binding which inhibits the CMTM6-PD-L1 interaction. We further identify an Hsp90α/β inhibitor, AUY-922, which induces Hsc70 expression and PD-L1 lysosomal degradation. Either Hsc70 overexpression or AUY-922 treatment can reduce PD-L1 expression, inhibit tumor growth and promote anti-tumor immunity in female mice; AUY-922 can further enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA4 treatment. Our study elucidates a molecular mechanism of Hsc70-mediated PD-L1 lysosomal degradation and provides a target and therapeutic strategies for tumor immunotherapy.",

Here we show that SPI1 fusions in combination with activating NRAS mutations drive an immature T-ALL in vivo using a conditional bone marrow transplant mouse model. Addition of the oncogenic fusion to the NRAS mutation also results in a higher leukemic stem cell frequency. Mechanistically, genetic deletion of the β-catenin binding domain within Transcription factor 7 (TCF7)-SPI1 or use of a TCF/β-catenin interaction antagonist abolishes the oncogenic activity of the fusion. Targeting the TCF7-SPI1 fusion in vivo with a doxycycline-inducible knockdown results in increased differentiation. Moreover, both pharmacological and genetic inhibition lead to down-regulation of SPI1 targets. Together, our results reveal an example where TCF7-SPI1 leukemia is vulnerable to pharmacological targeting of the TCF/β-catenin interaction.",

We subject our model to extensive experiments on data collected from multiple institutions comprising over 800,000 cells and six cancer types. To showcase the potential of our proposed framework, we apply VOLTA to ovarian and endometrial cancers and demonstrate that our cell representations can be utilized to identify the known histotypes of ovarian cancer and provide insights that link histopathology and molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer. Unlike supervised models, we provide a framework that can empower discoveries without any annotation data, even in situations where sample sizes are limited.",
TIM4 expression by dendritic cells mediates uptake of tumor-associated antigens and anti-tumor responses,"Nicoletta Caronni, Giulia Maria Piperno, Francesca Simoncello, Oriana Romano, Simone Vodret, Yuichi Yanagihashi, Regine Dress, Charles-Antoine Dutertre, Mattia Bugatti, Pierre Bourdeley, Annalisa Del Prete, Tiziana Schioppa, Emilia Maria Cristina Mazza, Licio Collavin, Serena Zacchigna, Renato Ostuni, Pierre Guermonprez, William Vermi, Florent Ginhoux, Silvio Bicciato, Shigekatzu Nagata, Federica Benvenuti",2021-04-14,"Acquisition of cell-associated tumor antigens by type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) is essential to induce and sustain tumor specific CD8+ T cells via cross-presentation. Here we show that capture and engulfment of cell associated antigens by tissue resident lung cDC1 is inhibited during progression of mouse lung tumors. Mechanistically, loss of phagocytosis is linked to tumor-mediated downregulation of the phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4, that is highly expressed in normal lung resident cDC1. TIM4 receptor blockade and conditional cDC1 deletion impair activation of tumor specific CD8+ T cells and promote tumor progression. In human lung adenocarcinomas, TIM4 transcripts increase the prognostic value of a cDC1 signature and predict responses to PD-1 treatment. Thus, TIM4 on lung resident cDC1 contributes to immune surveillance and its expression is suppressed in advanced tumors.",
Pretreatment with IL-15 and IL-18 rescues natural killer cells from granzyme B-mediated apoptosis after cryopreservation,"Abdulla Berjis, Deeksha Muthumani, Oscar A.

Using cryopreservation protocols optimized for T cells, here we find that ~75% of NK cells die within 24 h post-thaw, with the remaining cells displaying reduced cytotoxicity. Using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and confocal microscopy, we find that cryopreserved NK cells largely die via apoptosis initiated by leakage of granzyme B from cytotoxic vesicles. Pretreatment of NK cells with a combination of Interleukins-15 (IL-15) and IL-18 prior to cryopreservation improves NK cell recovery to ~90-100% and enables equal tumour control in a xenograft model of disseminated Raji cell lymphoma compared to non-cryopreserved NK cells.

Comparing the top decile with the bottom quintile of CRSs, the odds ratio of developing NPC is 21 (95% confidence interval: 12–37) in the validation dataset. When combining the top quintile of CRS with EBV serology tests currently used for NPC screening in southern China, the positive prediction value of screening increases from 4.70% (serology test alone) to 43.24% (CRS plus serology test). By identifying individuals at a monogenic level of NPC risk, this CRS approach provides opportunities for personalized risk prediction and population screening in endemic areas for the early diagnosis and secondary prevention of NPC.",

Bourgeois-Daigneault",2021-05-11,"By conferring systemic protection and durable benefits, cancer immunotherapies are emerging as long-term solutions for cancer treatment. One such approach that is currently undergoing clinical testing is a therapeutic anti-cancer vaccine that uses two different viruses expressing the same tumor antigen to prime and boost anti-tumor immunity. By providing the additional advantage of directly killing cancer cells, oncolytic viruses (OVs) constitute ideal platforms for such treatment strategy. However, given that the targeted tumor antigen is encoded into the viral genomes, its production requires robust infection and therefore, the vaccination efficiency partially depends on the unpredictable and highly variable intrinsic sensitivity of each tumor to OV infection. In this study, we demonstrate that anti-cancer vaccination using OVs (Adenovirus (Ad), Maraba virus (MRB), Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Vaccinia virus (VV)) co-administered with antigenic peptides is as efficient as antigen-engineered OVs and does not depend on viral replication. Our strategy is particularly attractive for personalized anti-cancer vaccines targeting patient-specific mutations. We suggest that the use of OVs as adjuvant platforms for therapeutic anti-cancer vaccination warrants testing for cancer treatment.",
Bone marrow stromal cells induce chromatin remodeling in multiple myeloma cells leading to transcriptional changes,"Moritz Binder, Raphael E.

Munshi",2024-05-16,"The natural history of multiple myeloma is characterized by its localization to the bone marrow and its interaction with bone marrow stromal cells. The bone marrow stromal cells provide growth and survival signals, thereby promoting the development of drug resistance. Here, we show that the interaction between bone marrow stromal cells and myeloma cells (using human cell lines) induces chromatin remodeling of cis-regulatory elements and is associated with changes in the expression of genes involved in the cell migration and cytokine signaling. The expression of genes involved in these stromal interactions are observed in extramedullary disease in patients with myeloma and provides the rationale for survival of myeloma cells outside of the bone marrow microenvironment. Expression of these stromal interaction genes is also observed in a subset of patients with newly diagnosed myeloma and are akin to the transcriptional program of extramedullary disease. The presence of such adverse stromal interactions in newly diagnosed myeloma is associated with accelerated disease dissemination, predicts the early development of therapeutic resistance, and is of independent prognostic significance. These stromal cell induced transcriptomic and epigenomic changes both predict long-term outcomes and identify therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) may contribute to treatment failure. However, the extent of ITH in SCLC is still largely unknown. Here, we subject 120 tumor samples from 40 stage I-III SCLC patients to multi-regional whole-exome sequencing. The most common mutant genes are TP53 (88%) and RB1 (72%). We observe a medium level of mutational heterogeneity (0.30, range 0.0~0.98) and tumor mutational burden (TMB, 10.2 mutations/Mb, range 1.1~51.7). Our SCLC samples also exhibit somatic copy number variation (CNV) across all patients, with an average CNV ITH of 0.49 (range 0.02~0.99). In terms of mutation distribution, ITH, TMB, mutation clusters, and gene signatures, patients with combined SCLC behave roughly the same way as patients with pure SCLC. This condition also exists in smoking patients and patients with EGFR mutations. A higher TMB per cluster is associated with better disease-free survival while single-nucleotide variant ITH is linked to worse overall survival, and therefore these features may be used as prognostic biomarkers for SCLC. Together, these findings demonstrate the intratumoral genetic heterogeneity of surgically resected SCLC and provide insights into resistance to treatment.",
Endothelial deletion of SHP2 suppresses tumor angiogenesis and promotes vascular normalization,"Zhiyong Xu, Chunyi Guo, Qiaoli Ye, Yueli Shi, Yihui Sun, Jie Zhang, Jiaqi Huang, Yizhou Huang, Chunlai Zeng, Xue Zhang, Yuehai Ke, Hongqiang Cheng",2021-11-02,"SHP2 mediates the activities of multiple receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and its function in endothelial processes has been explored extensively. However, genetic studies on the role of SHP2 in tumor angiogenesis have not been conducted. Here, we show that SHP2 is activated in tumor endothelia. Shp2 deletion and pharmacological inhibition reduce tumor growth and microvascular density in multiple mouse tumor models. Shp2 deletion also leads to tumor vascular normalization, indicated by increased pericyte coverage and vessel perfusion. SHP2 inefficiency impairs endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis through downregulating the expression of proangiogenic SRY-Box transcription factor 7 (SOX7), whose re-expression restores endothelial function in SHP2-knockdown cells and tumor growth, angiogenesis, and vascular abnormalization in Shp2-deleted mice. SHP2 stabilizes apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which regulates SOX7 expression mediated by c-Jun. Our studies suggest SHP2 in tumor associated endothelial cells is a promising anti-angiogenic target for cancer therapy.",

Molecular analysis of the histologically distinct tumor populations confirmed molecular evidence of differential HER2 expression but also suggested clonal relatedness of the two tumor populations based upon mutational profile, with phenotypic divergence potentially resulting from copy number alterations in NF1. Overall, this case highlights a rare histologic phenomenon that was successfully treated by combining both TNBC and HER2 directed neoadjuvant therapies.",
A comprehensive characterization of the cell-free transcriptome reveals tissue- and subtype-specific biomarkers for cancer detection,"Matthew H. Larson, Wenying Pan, Hyunsung John Kim, Ruth E. Mauntz, Sarah M. Stuart, Monica Pimentel, Yiqi Zhou, Per Knudsgaard, Vasiliki Demas, Alexander M. Aravanis, Arash Jamshidi",2021-04-21,"Cell-free RNA (cfRNA) is a promising analyte for cancer detection. However, a comprehensive assessment of cfRNA in individuals with and without cancer has not been conducted. We perform the first transcriptome-wide characterization of cfRNA in cancer (stage III breast [n = 46], lung [n = 30]) and non-cancer (n = 89) participants from the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (NCT02889978). Of 57,820 annotated genes, 39,564 (68%) are not detected in cfRNA from non-cancer individuals. Within these low-noise regions, we identify tissue- and cancer-specific genes, defined as “dark channel biomarker” (DCB) genes, that are recurrently detected in individuals with cancer. DCB levels in plasma correlate with tumor shedding rate and RNA expression in matched tissue, suggesting that DCBs with high expression in tumor tissue could enhance cancer detection in patients with low levels of circulating tumor DNA. Overall, cfRNA provides a unique opportunity to detect cancer, predict the tumor tissue of origin, and determine the cancer subtype.",
Theranostic near-infrared-IIb emitting nanoprobes for promoting immunogenic radiotherapy and abscopal effects against cancer metastasis,"Hao Li, Meng Wang, Biao Huang, Su-Wen Zhu, Jun-Jie Zhou, De-Run Chen, Ran Cui, Mingxi Zhang, Zhi-Jun Sun",2021-12-09,"Radiotherapy is an important therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment through direct damage to cancer cells and augmentation of antitumor immune responses. However, the efficacy of radiotherapy is limited by hypoxia-mediated radioresistance and immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment. Here, we construct a stabilized theranostic nanoprobe based on quantum dots emitting in the near-infrared IIb (NIR-IIb, 1,500–1,700 nm) window modified by catalase, arginine–glycine–aspartate peptides and poly(ethylene glycol). We demonstrate that the nanoprobes effectively aggregate in the tumor site to locate the tumor region, thereby realizing precision radiotherapy with few side-effects. In addition, nanoprobes relieve intratumoral hypoxia and reduce the tumor infiltration of immunosuppressive cells. Moreover, the nanoprobes promote the immunogenic cell death of cancer cells to trigger the activation of dendritic cells and enhance T cell-mediated antitumor immunity to inhibit tumor metastasis. Collectively, the nanoprobe-mediated immunogenic radiotherapy can boost the abscopal effect to inhibit tumor metastasis and prolong survival.",
The telomere length landscape of prostate cancer,"Julie Livingstone, Yu-Jia Shiah, Takafumi N. Yamaguchi, Lawrence E.

Boutros",2021-11-25,"Replicative immortality is a hallmark of cancer, and can be achieved through telomere lengthening and maintenance. Although the role of telomere length in cancer has been well studied, its association to genomic features is less well known. Here, we report the telomere lengths of 392 localized prostate cancer tumours and characterize their relationship to genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic features. Shorter tumour telomere lengths are associated with elevated genomic instability, including single-nucleotide variants, indels and structural variants. Genes involved in cell proliferation and signaling are correlated with tumour telomere length at all levels of the central dogma. Telomere length is also associated with multiple clinical features of a tumour. Longer telomere lengths in non-tumour samples are associated with a lower rate of biochemical relapse. In summary, we describe the multi-level integration of telomere length, genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics in localized prostate cancer.",
A multicenter proof-of-concept study on deep learning-based intraoperative discrimination of primary central nervous system lymphoma,"Xinke Zhang, Zihan Zhao, Ruixuan Wang, Haohua Chen, Xueyi Zheng, Lili Liu, Lilong Lan, Peng Li, Shuyang Wu, Qinghua Cao, Rongzhen Luo, Wanming Hu, Shanshan lyu, Zhengyu Zhang, Dan Xie, Yaping Ye, Yu Wang, Muyan Cai",2024-05-04,"Accurate intraoperative differentiation of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) remains pivotal in guiding neurosurgical decisions. However, distinguishing PCNSL from other lesions, notably glioma, through frozen sections challenges pathologists. Here we sought to develop and validate a deep learning model capable of precisely distinguishing PCNSL from non-PCNSL lesions, especially glioma, using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained frozen whole-slide images. Also, we compared its performance against pathologists of varying expertise. Additionally, a human-machine fusion approach integrated both model and pathologic diagnostics. In external cohorts, LGNet achieved AUROCs of 0.965 and 0.972 in distinguishing PCNSL from glioma and AUROCs of 0.981 and 0.993 in differentiating PCNSL from non-PCNSL lesions. Outperforming several pathologists, LGNet significantly improved diagnostic performance, further augmented to some extent by fusion approach. LGNet’s proficiency in frozen section analysis and its synergy with pathologists indicate its valuable role in intraoperative diagnosis, particularly in discriminating PCNSL from glioma, alongside other lesions.",
The IRENA lncRNA converts chemotherapy-polarized tumor-suppressing macrophages to tumor-promoting phenotypes in breast cancer,"Jiang Liu, Liyan Lao, Jianing Chen, Jiang Li, Wenfeng Zeng, Xiaofeng Zhu, Jiaqian Li, Xueman Chen, Linbin Yang, Yue Xing, Fei Chen, Di Huang, Xiaoqian Zhang, Wei Wei, Chang Gong, Shuya Huang, Zhigang Yu, Zhihua Li, Linhan Yang, Jinping Liu, Xiaozhen Liu, Qinghui Zheng, Xuli Meng, Jing Liang, Luyang Sun, Musheng Zeng, Mengfeng Li, Qiang Liu, Shicheng Su, Erwei Song",2021-04-12,"Although chemotherapy can stimulate antitumor immunity by inducing interferon (IFN) response, the functional role of tumor-associated macrophages in this scenario remains unclear. Here, we found that IFN-activated proinflammatory macrophages after neoadjuvant chemotherapy enhanced antitumor immunity but promoted cancer chemoresistance. Mechanistically, IFN induced expression of cytoplasmic long noncoding RNA IFN-responsive nuclear factor-κB activator (IRENA) in macrophages, which triggered nuclear factor-κB signaling via dimerizing protein kinase R and subsequently increased production of protumor inflammatory cytokines. By constructing macrophage-conditional IRENA-knockout mice, we found that targeting IRENA in IFN-activated macrophages abrogated their protumor effects, while retaining their capacity to enhance antitumor immunity. Clinically, IRENA expression in post-chemotherapy macrophages was associated with poor patient survival. These findings indicate that lncRNA can determine the dichotomy of inflammatory cells on cancer progression and antitumor immunity and suggest that targeting IRENA is an effective therapeutic strategy to reversing tumor-promoting inflammation.",

Espejo, James P. Allison, Shalini S. Yadav, Padmanee Sharma",2021-11-04,"Cryoablation in combination with immune checkpoint therapy was previously reported to improve anti-tumor immune responses in pre-clinical studies. Here we report a pilot study of anti-CTLA-4 (tremelimumab) with (n = 15) or without (n = 14) cryoablation in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (NCT02626130), 18 patients with clear cell and 11 patients with non-clear cell histologies. The primary endpoint is safety, secondary endpoints include objective response rate, progression-free survival, and immune monitoring studies. Safety data indicate ≥ grade 3 treatment-related adverse events in 16 of 29 patients (55%) including 6 diarrhea/colitis, 3 hepatitis, 1 pneumonitis, and 1 glomerulonephritis. Toxicity leading to treatment discontinuation occurs in 5 patients in each arm. 3 patients with clear cell histology experience durable responses. One patient in the tremelimumab arm experiences an objective response, the median progression-free survival for all patients is 3.3 months (95% CI: 2.0, 5.3 months). Exploratory immune monitoring analysis of baseline and post-treatment tumor tissue samples shows that treatment increases immune cell infiltration and tertiary lymphoid structures in clear cell but not in non-clear cell. In clear cell, cryoablation plus tremelimumab leads to a significant increase in immune cell infiltration. These data highlight that treatment with tremelimumab plus cryotherapy is feasible and modulates the immune microenvironment in patients with metastatic clear cell histology.",
Spindle cell sarcoma: a SEER population-based analysis,"Lei Feng, Meng Wang, Feiluore Yibulayin, Hao Zhang, Yin-Long Yang, Fei Ren, Alimujiang Wushou",2018-03-22,"Due to the substantial limitation of study population, Spindle cell sarcoma (SCS) was unexplored comprehensively. In this study, we investigated the clinical characteristics and disease specific prognostic factors of SCS. 3299 SCS cases were identified and extracted from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1973–2017). White people account for 79.1% with median age of 57 years without predominance in any gender. Significant disease specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were found differentiated in age, T stage, N stage, M stage, AJCC stage, SEER historic stage, tumor locations, surgery, and pathologic grade. In the multivariate Cox analysis, the age >64 years (for DSS, P < 0.001 and for OS, P < 0.001; Reference age ≤64 years), AJCC stage III (for DSS, P = 0.006 and for OS, P = 0.04; Reference: AJCC stage I), and non-surgical treatment (for DSS, P < 0.001 and for OS, P < 0.001; Reference: surgery) were independently associated with worse DSS and OS. In brief, our study demonstrated that SCS mostly found in white people at fifth to seventh decades of life without gender predilection. The patient’s age, AJCC stage, tumor location and surgery were independent prognostic indicators for both DSS and OS of SCS.",
Propensity-score-matched evaluation of the incidence of radiation pneumonitis and secondary cancer risk for breast cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT,"Pei-Ju Chao, Hsiao-Fei Lee, Jen-Hong Lan, Shih-Sian Guo, Hui-Min Ting, Yu-Jie Huang, Hui-Chun Chen, Tsair-Fwu Lee",2017-10-23,"Propensity score matching evaluates the treatment incidence of radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) and secondary cancer risk (SCR) after intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for breast cancer patients. Of 32 patients treated with IMRT and 58 who received VMAT were propensity matched in a 1:1 ratio. RP and SCR were evaluated as the endpoints of acute and chronic toxicity, respectively. Self-fitted normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) parameter values were used to analyze the risk of RP. SCRs were evaluated using the preferred Schneider’s parameterization risk models. The dosimetric parameter of the ipsilateral lung volume receiving 40 Gy (IV40) was selected as the dominant risk factor for the RP NTCP model. The results showed that the risks of RP and NTCP, as well as that of SCR of the ipsilateral lung, were slightly lower than the values in patients treated with VMAT versus IMRT (p ≤ 0.01). However, the organ equivalent dose and excess absolute risk values in the contralateral lung and breast were slightly higher with VMAT than with IMRT (p ≤ 0.05). When compared to IMRT, VMAT is a rational radiotherapy option for breast cancer patients, based on its reduced potential for inducing secondary malignancies and RP complications.",
Comparative molecular profiling of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma of the head versus body and tail,"Maen Abdelrahim, Abdullah Esmail, Anup Kasi, Nestor F. Esnaola, Joanne Xiu, Yasmine Baca, Benjamin A. Weinberg",2024-04-06,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) of the head (H) and body/tail (B/T) differ in embryonic origin, cell composition, blood supply, lymphatic and venous drainage, and innervation. We aimed to compare the molecular and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) profiles of PDAC of the H vs. B/T. A total of 3499 PDAC samples were analyzed via next-generation sequencing (NGS) of RNA (whole transcriptome, NovaSeq), DNA (NextSeq, 592 genes or NovaSeq, whole exome sequencing), and immunohistochemistry (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ). Significance was determined as p values adjusted for multiple corrections (q) of <0.05. Anatomic subsites of PDAC tumors were grouped by primary tumor sites into H (N = 2058) or B/T (N = 1384). There were significantly more metastatic tumors profiled from B/T vs. H (57% vs. 44%, p < 0.001). KRAS mutations (93.8% vs. 90.2%), genomic loss of heterozygosity (12.7% vs. 9.1%), and several copy number alterations (FGF3, FGF4, FGF19, CCND1, ZNF703, FLT4, MUTYH, TNFRS14) trended higher in B/T when compared to H (p < 0.05 but q > 0.05). Expression analysis of immuno-oncology (IO)-related genes showed significantly higher expression of CTLA4 and PDCD1 in H (q < 0.05, fold change 1.2 and 1.3) and IDO1 and PDCD1LG2 expression trended higher in B/T (p < 0.05, fold change 0.95). To our knowledge, this is one of the largest cohorts of PDAC tumors subjected to broad molecular profiling. Differences in IO-related gene expression and TIME cell distribution suggest that response to IO therapies may differ in PDAC arising from H vs. B/T. Subtle differences in the genomic profiles of H vs. B/T tumors were observed.",
Clinicopathological correlation of ARID1A status with HDAC6 and its related factors in ovarian clear cell carcinoma,"Mitsutake Yano, Tomomi Katoh, Mariko Miyazawa, Masaki Miyazawa, Naoki Ogane, Maiko Miwa, Kosei Hasegawa, Hisashi Narahara, Masanori Yasuda",2019-02-20,"Ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is associated with a frequent loss in ARID1A function. ARID1A reportedly suppresses histone deacetylase (HDAC)6 in OCCC directly. Here, we evaluated the clinical significance of HDAC6 expression and its related factors in terms of ARID1A status. Immunohistochemical expression of HDAC6, hypoxia inducible factors-1α (HIF-1α), programmed death-1 ligand (PD-L1), CD44 (cancer stem cell marker), and ARID1A was analysed for 106 OCCC patients. High nuclear HDAC6 expression correlated with patient death (p = 0.038). In the multivariate analysis of overall survival, surgical status (complete or incomplete resection) (hazard ratio (HR) = 17.5; p = <0.001), HDAC6 nuclear expression (HR = 1.68; p = 0.034), and PD-L1 expression (HR = 1.95; p = 0.022) were the independent prognostic factors. HDAC6 upregulation and ARID1A loss did not necessarily occur simultaneously. High HDAC6 expression was associated with poor prognosis in OCCC with ARID1A loss; this was not observed without ARID1A loss. HDAC6 expression showed a significant positive correlation with HIF-1α, PD-L1, and CD44. In OCCC, HDAC6 involvement in prognosis depended on ARID1A status. HDAC6 also led to immuno- and hypoxia- tolerance and cancer stem cell phenotype. HDAC6 is a promising therapeutic target for OCCC with loss of ARID1A.",
Preoperative prediction of CNS WHO grade and tumour aggressiveness in intracranial meningioma based on radiomics and structured semantics,"Darius Kalasauskas, Michael Kosterhon, Elena Kurz, Leon Schmidt, Sebastian Altmann, Nils F. Grauhan, Clemens Sommer, Ahmed Othman, Marc A. Brockmann, Florian Ringel, Naureen Keric",2024-09-04,"Preoperative identification of intracranial meningiomas with aggressive behaviour may help in choosing the optimal treatment strategy. Radiomics is emerging as a powerful diagnostic tool with potential applications in patient risk stratification. In this study, we aimed to compare the predictive value of conventional, semantic based and radiomic analyses to determine CNS WHO grade and early tumour relapse in intracranial meningiomas. We performed a single-centre retrospective analysis of intracranial meningiomas operated between 2007 and 2018. Recurrence within 5 years after Simpson Grade I-III resection was considered as early. Preoperative T1 CE MRI sequences were analysed conventionally by two radiologists. Additionally a semantic feature score based on systematic analysis of morphological characteristics was developed and a radiomic analysis were performed. For the radiomic model, tumour volume was extracted manually, 791 radiomic features were extracted. Eight feature selection algorithms and eight machine learning methods were used. Models were analysed using test and training datasets. In total, 226 patients were included. There were 21% CNS WHO grade 2 tumours, no CNS WHO grade 3 tumour, and 25 (11%) tumour recurrences were detected in total. In ROC analysis the best radiomic models demonstrated superior performance for determination of CNS WHO grade (AUC 0.930) and early recurrence (AUC 0.892) in comparison to the semantic feature score (AUC 0.74 and AUC 0.65) and conventional radiological analysis (AUC 0.65 and 0.54). The combination of human classifiers, semantic score and radiomic analysis did not markedly increase the model performance. Radiomic analysis is a promising tool for preoperative identification of aggressive and atypical intracranial meningiomas and could become a useful tool in the future.","Meningioma, Radiomics, Recurrence, CNS WHO grade, Prediction"
Neck Lymph Node Metastasis as A Poor Prognostic Factor in Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients Receiving Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis,"Yen-Hao Chen, Hung-I Lu, Chien-Ming Lo, Yu-Ming Wang, Shang-Yu Chou, Chang-Chun Hsiao, Li-Hsueh Shih, Su-Wei Chen, Shau-Hsuan Li",2018-10-10,"The present study investigated the clinical impact of neck lymph node (LN) metastasis in locally advanced inoperable thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with a curative intent. There were 404 ESCC patients enrolled, including 35 patients with neck LN metastasis and 369 patients without such metastasis. Through the propensity score matching method, 35 patients of the 369 patients without neck LN metastasis were matched to the 35 patients with neck LN metastasis. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were found to be significantly worse in the neck LN metastasis group compared to the full non-neck LN metastasis group (9.8 months versus 5.9 months, P < 0.001, and 18.2 months versus 9.7 months, P = 0.001) and the matched non-neck LN metastasis group (9.9 months versus 5.9 months, P = 0.006, and 19.4 months versus 9.7 months, P = 0.007). In order to determine the difference between neck LN and supraclavicular LN metastasis, seventy patients with supraclavicular LN metastasis were also selected from the 369 patients without neck LN metastasis for comparison. Subsequently, when compared to the ESCC patients with supraclavicular LN metastasis, significantly worse PFS (8.5 months versus 5.9 months, P = 0.026) and OS (17.2 months versus 9.7 months, P = 0.047) were still found in the ESCC patients with neck LN metastasis. Our study indicates that neck LN metastasis is an independent poor prognostic factor for locally advanced inoperable thoracic ESCC patients who have undergone CCRT.","ESCC Patients, Thoracic ESCC, Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), 369 ESCC, Propensity Score Matching Method"
Outcomes of adjuvant epithelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) treatment for EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer: a propensity-score analysis,"Shufen Zhao, Ge Ma, Jing Guo, Aiping Ding, Shasha Wang, Guohong Yu, Lei Chen, Yonggang Yuan, Wenjing Xiao",2017-09-14,"Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have transformed the management of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring activating epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, while the efficacy of TKIs in the adjuvant setting remains unclear. We collected the data of 209 EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients receiving complete resection from 2010 to 2013. Study end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Among the eligible patients, 41 (19.6%) received EGFR TKIs in the adjuvant treatment. The 3-year DFS of adjuvant EGFR TKIs treatment group (70.5%, 95% CI, 54.6–86.4%) was significantly superior that control group (50.2%, 95% CI, 40–60.4%; log-rank P = 0.014). TKIs treatment (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29–0.97; P = 0.04) was significantly associated with improved DFS in multivariate Cox analysis. No significant difference was observed in 3-year OS between two groups (73.1% [58.0–88.2%] vs 61.8% [52.2–71.4%], log-rank P = 0.21). Propensity-score matching further confirmed that adjuvant TKIs treatment extended the DFS (log-rank P = 0.024), but did not improve OS (log-rank P = 0.40). Our analysis revealed that adjuvant EGFR TKIs treatment was beneficial for early-stage NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR mutations after complete resection.",
Predicting non-melanoma skin cancer via a multi-parameterized artificial neural network,"David Roffman, Gregory Hart, Michael Girardi, Christine J. Ko, Jun Deng",2018-01-26,"Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure and family history are major associated risk factors for the development of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC). The objective of this study was to develop and validate a multi-parameterized artificial neural network based on available personal health information for early detection of NMSC with high sensitivity and specificity, even in the absence of known UVR exposure and family history. The 1997–2015 NHIS adult survey data used to train and validate our neural network (NN) comprised of 2,056 NMSC and 460,574 non-cancer cases. We extracted 13 parameters for our NN: gender, age, BMI, diabetic status, smoking status, emphysema, asthma, race, Hispanic ethnicity, hypertension, heart diseases, vigorous exercise habits, and history of stroke. This study yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.81 and 0.81 for training and validation, respectively. Our results (training sensitivity 88.5% and specificity 62.2%, validation sensitivity 86.2% and specificity 62.7%) were comparable to a previous study of basal and squamous cell carcinoma prediction that also included UVR exposure and family history information. These results indicate that our NN is robust enough to make predictions, suggesting that we have identified novel associations and potential predictive parameters of NMSC.",
Treatment of splenic flexure colon cancer: a comparison of three different surgical procedures: Experience of a high volume cancer center,"Daniela Rega, Ugo Pace, Dario Scala, Paolo Chiodini, Vincenza Granata, Andrea Fares Bucci, Biagio Pecori, Paolo Delrio",2019-07-29,"Extended right or left hemicolectomy are the most common surgical treatments for splenic flexure colon cancer. Extended resection (including distal pancreasectomy and/or splenectomy), has been often indicated for the treatment for the splenic flexure cancer, because the lymphatic drainage at this site is poorly defined and assumed as heterogeneous. Between January 2006 and May 2016, 103 patients with splenic flexure colon cancer were enrolled in the study. We evaluated the clinicopathological findings and outcomes of all patients and associated them to the different surgical treatment. Out of 103 selected cases an extended right hemicolectomy was performed in 22 (21.4%) patients, an extended left hemicolectomy in 24 (23.3%) patients, a segmental resection of the splenic flexure in 57 (55.3%) patients; the combined resection of adjacent organs showing tumor adherence was carried out in 11 (10.7%) patients. The tumor infiltrated near organs (T4) in 5 patients. No significant differences in complications were found among the three groups. In all groups no differences were found in the total number of harvested lymphnodes. After a median follow-up of 42 months, 30 recurrences and 19 deaths occurred (12 for tumor progression). There was no difference in overall and progression free survival among the three different surgical treatments. According to our results, the partial resection of splenic flexure was not associated with a worse prognosis and it was leading for a satisfactory oncological outcome. It is our opinion that the extended surgery is seldomly indicated to cure splenic flexure cancer.",

They achieve this through TERT activation or alternative telomere lengthening associated with ATRX or DAXX loss. Here, as part of the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium, we dissect whole-genome sequencing data of over 2500 matched tumor-control samples from 36 different tumor types aggregated within the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium to characterize the genomic footprints of these mechanisms. While the telomere content of tumors with ATRX or DAXX mutations (ATRX/DAXXtrunc) is increased, tumors with TERT modifications show a moderate decrease of telomere content. One quarter of all tumor samples contain somatic integrations of telomeric sequences into non-telomeric DNA. This fraction is increased to 80% prevalence in ATRX/DAXXtrunc tumors, which carry an aberrant telomere variant repeat (TVR) distribution as another genomic marker. The latter feature includes enrichment or depletion of the previously undescribed singleton TVRs TTCGGG and TTTGGG, respectively. Our systematic analysis provides new insight into the recurrent genomic alterations associated with telomere maintenance mechanisms in cancer.",

We estimate that low variant allele fraction (VAF < 15%) and clonal heterogeneity contribute up to 68% of private WGS mutations and 71% of private WES mutations. We observe that ~30% of private WGS mutations trace to mutations identified by a single variant caller in WES consensus efforts. WGS captures both ~50% more variation in exonic regions and un-observed mutations in loci with variable GC-content.

Hahn, Francisca Vazquez",2024-10-28,"Despite tremendous progress in the past decade, the complex and heterogeneous nature of cancer complicates efforts to identify new therapies and therapeutic combinations that achieve durable responses in most patients. Further advances in cancer therapy will rely, in part, on the development of targeted therapeutics matched with the genetic and molecular characteristics of cancer. The Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) is a large-scale data repository and research platform, aiming to systematically reveal the landscape of cancer vulnerabilities in thousands of genetically and molecularly annotated cancer models. DepMap is used routinely by cancer researchers and translational scientists and has facilitated the identification of several novel and selective therapeutic strategies for multiple cancer types that are being tested in the clinic. However, it is also clear that the current version of DepMap is not yet comprehensive. In this Perspective, we review (1) the impact and current uses of DepMap, (2) the opportunities to enhance DepMap to overcome its current limitations, and (3) the ongoing efforts to further improve and expand DepMap.",
An investigation of tomosynthesis on the diagnostic efficacy of spot compression mammography,"Ying Jiang, Lilin Yang, Rong Qian, Mingfang Li, Hong Pu, Aamer Rasheed Chughtai, Jinliang Hu, Weifang Kong",2024-07-16,"To explore the diagnostic efficacy of tomosynthesis spot compression (TSC) compared with conventional spot compression (CSC) for ambiguous findings on full-field digital mammography (FFDM). In this retrospective study, 122 patients (including 108 patients with dense breasts) with ambiguous FFDM findings were imaged with both CSC and TSC. Two radiologists independently reviewed the images and evaluated lesions using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. Pathology or at least a 1-year follow-up imaging was used as the reference standard. Diagnostic efficacies of CSC and TSC were compared, including area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). The mean glandular dose was recorded and compared for TSC and CSC. Of the 122 patients, 63 had benign lesions and 59 had malignant lesions. For Reader 1, the following diagnostic efficacies of TSC were significantly higher than those of CSC: AUC (0.988 vs. 0.906, P = 0.001), accuracy (93.4% vs. 77.8%, P = 0.001), specificity (87.3% vs. 63.5%, P = 0.002), PPV (88.1% vs. 70.5%, P = 0.010), and NPV (100% vs. 90.9%, P = 0.029). For Reader 2, TSC showed higher AUC (0.949 vs. 0.909, P = 0.011) and accuracy (83.6% vs. 71.3%, P = 0.022) than CSC. The mean glandular dose of TSC was higher than that of CSC (1.85 ± 0.53 vs. 1.47 ± 0.58 mGy, P < 0.001) but remained within the safety limit. TSC provides better diagnostic efficacy with a slightly higher but tolerable radiation dose than CSC. Therefore, TSC may be a candidate modality for patients with ambiguous findings on FFDM.","Spot compression view, Tomosynthesis, Breast, Diagnostic efficacy, Mammography"
Master corepressor inactivation through multivalent SLiM-induced polymerization mediated by the oncogene suppressor RAI2,"Nishit Goradia, Stefan Werner, Edukondalu Mullapudi, Sarah Greimeier, Lina Bergmann, Andras Lang, Haydyn Mertens, Aleksandra Węglarz, Simon Sander, Grzegorz Chojnowski, Harriet Wikman, Oliver Ohlenschläger, Gunhild von Amsberg, Klaus Pantel, Matthias Wilmanns",2024-06-19,"While the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms of folded proteins is facilitated due to their amenability to high-resolution structural characterization, investigation of these mechanisms in disordered proteins is more challenging due to their structural heterogeneity, which can be captured by a variety of biophysical approaches. Here, we used the transcriptional master corepressor CtBP, which binds the putative metastasis suppressor RAI2 through repetitive SLiMs, as a model system. Using cryo-electron microscopy embedded in an integrative structural biology approach, we show that RAI2 unexpectedly induces CtBP polymerization through filaments of stacked tetrameric CtBP layers. These filaments lead to RAI2-mediated CtBP nuclear foci and relieve its corepressor function in RAI2-expressing cancer cells. The impact of RAI2-mediated CtBP loss-of-function is illustrated by the analysis of a diverse cohort of prostate cancer patients, which reveals a substantial decrease in RAI2 in advanced treatment-resistant cancer subtypes. As RAI2-like SLiM motifs are found in a wide range of organisms, including pathogenic viruses, our findings serve as a paradigm for diverse functional effects through multivalent interaction-mediated polymerization by disordered proteins in healthy and diseased conditions.",

This randomized phase II trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant fulvestrant (Fulv) alone or with enzalutamide (Combo) assessed whether adding AR blockade to Fulv would limit residual tumor at the time of surgery, as measured by modified preoperative endocrine predictive index (PEPI) score. Eligible patients were women with ER+/HER2− primary BC cT2 or greater. Stratification factors were clinical node and T-stage. Fresh tumor biopsies were required at study entry, after 4 weeks on therapy (W5), and at surgery. Laboratory analyses on tumors included immunochemistry (IHC) for ER/PR/AR/GR and Ki67 protein, evaluation of gene expression, multiplex for myeloid lineage immune cells, reverse-phase protein array, and plasma metabolomic analyses. Of 69 consented patients, 59 were evaluable. Toxicity was as expected with endocrine therapy. Combo achieved PEPI = 0 more frequently (24%: 8/33) than Fulv (8%: 2/26). Ki67 was ≤10% across arms by W5 in 76% of tumors. Activation of mTOR pathway proteins was elevated in tumors with poor Ki67 response. Tumors in both arms showed decreased estrogen-regulated and cell division gene sets, while Combo arm tumors uniquely exhibited enrichment of immune activation gene sets, including interferon gamma, complement, inflammation, antigen processing, and B and T cell activation. Multiplex IHC showed significantly reduced tumor-associated macrophages and CD14+/HLADR−/CD68− MDSCs in Combo tumors at W5. In summary, Combo tumors showed a higher PEPI = 0 response, Ki67 response, and more activated tumor immune microenvironment than Fulv. The odds of response were 4.6-fold higher for patients with ILC versus IDC.

Manganese pollution in eastern India causing cancer risk,"Arun Kumar, Rajiv Kumar, Govind Kumar, Kanhaiya Kumar, Nirmal Kumar Chayal, Siddhant Aryal, Mukesh Kumar, Abhinav Srivastava, Mohammad Ali, Vivek Raj, Akhouri Bishwapriya, Muskan Manjari, Deepak Kumar, Santosh Kumar, Manisha Singh, Ashok Kumar Ghosh",2024-11-19,"Groundwater poisoning by heavy metals has caused serious health hazards in the exposed population globally. Manganese (Mn) poisoning causing human health hazards is very meagerly reported worldwide. The present research elucidates for the first time the catastrophic effect of manganese causing cancer in the Gangetic plains of Bihar (India). The blood samples of n = 1146 cancer patients were voluntarily obtained for the study, after their consent. Their household water samples were also collected for the study. All the samples were analysed for Mn contamination by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. The study indicates high Mn contamination in the cancer patient blood samples with highest content as 6022 µg/L. Moreover, the cancer patient’s household handpump water samples also contained elevated Mn contamination. The correlation coefficient study finds significant association between Mn contamination in blood of cancer patients and their handpump water. The carcinoma group of cancer patients mostly in Stage III & IV had significant Mn contamination in their blood (above WHO/BIS permissible limit). The geospatial study depicts Mn contamination in handpump water in the state of Bihar in correlation with cancer patient’s blood samples. This novel finding is being reported in India for the first time, which correlates cancer with handpump drinking water. The long-term Mn exposure could be one of the causative agents for elevating cancer incidences. However, other confounding risk factors cannot be denied.","Manganese poisoning, Cancer patients, Geospatial study, Health risk assessment, Bihar"
Expanding cross-presenting dendritic cells enhances oncolytic virotherapy and is critical for long-term anti-tumor immunity,"Judit Svensson-Arvelund, Sara Cuadrado-Castano, Gvantsa Pantsulaia, Kristy Kim, Mark Aleynick, Linda Hammerich, Ranjan Upadhyay, Michael Yellin, Henry Marsh, Daniel Oreper, Suchit Jhunjhunwala, Christine Moussion, Miriam Merad, Brian D. Brown, Adolfo García-Sastre, Joshua D. Brody",2022-11-22,"Immunotherapies directly enhancing anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses have yielded measurable but limited success, highlighting the need for alternatives. Anti-tumor T cell responses critically depend on antigen presenting dendritic cells (DC), and enhancing mobilization, antigen loading and activation of these cells represent an attractive possibility to potentiate T cell based therapies. Here we show that expansion of DCs by Flt3L administration impacts in situ vaccination with oncolytic Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). Mechanistically, NDV activates DCs and sensitizes them to dying tumor cells through upregulation of dead-cell receptors and synergizes with Flt3L to promote anti-tumor CD8+ T cell cross-priming. In vivo, Flt3L-NDV in situ vaccination induces parallel amplification of virus- and tumor-specific T cells, including CD8+ T cells reactive to newly-described neoepitopes, promoting long-term tumor control. Cross-presenting conventional Type 1 DCs are indispensable for the anti-tumor, but not anti-viral, T cell response, and type I IFN-dependent CD4+ Th1 effector cells contribute to optimal anti-tumor immunity. These data demonstrate that mobilizing DCs to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation improves oncolytic virotherapy and that neoepitope-specific T cells can be induced without individualized, ex vivo manufactured vaccines.",
Comprehensive profiling of extrachromosomal circular DNAs in colorectal cancer progression,"Lu Lu, Mingjie Chen, Guicheng Zhang, Yujing Liu, Xiangyuan Xu, Zenghua Jiang, Yangxian Xu, Tao Liu, Fan Yang, Guang Ji, Hanchen Xu",2024-11-18,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) development involves a series of molecular events that drive the progression from normal colorectal epithelium to adenoma and eventually to invasive carcinoma. While the involvement of extrachromosomal circular DNAs (ecDNAs) in cancer genome remodeling has been established, their specific roles in CRC formation remain unclear. Using Circle-Sequencing and whole transcriptomic sequencing, we comprehensively profile circular DNAs and transcriptomes in healthy individuals, colorectal adenoma, and CRC patients. Our delineate analyses characterize the key circular DNAs involved in oncogene expression through the normal-adenoma–carcinoma continuum and highlight that immune response-related pathways and cell cycle pathways, are the dominat events in CRC progression. Notably, chr8 ecDNA 64950741–114379093 exhibits robust up-regulation during CRC progression. Further validation in a new cohort of 50 CRC patients confirms the higher expression of chr8 ecDNA 64950741–114379093 and its strong correlation with poor prognosis. Thus, these findings provide unprecedented insights into the landscape of circular DNAs in CRC and highlights the potential of chr8 ecDNA 64950741–114379093 as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC management.","Circular DNAs, chr8 ecDNA 64950741–114379093, CRC progression, Biomarker"
Association between chronic stress-related amygdala metabolic activity and lymph node metastasis in endometrial cancer,"Ki-Jin Ryu, Sungeun Kim, Chanmin Joung, Sanghoon Lee, Hyuntae Park, Jae Yun Song, Ki Joo Pahk, Kisoo Pahk",2024-11-18,"Chronic stress’s link to endometrial cancer risk and tumor aggressiveness remains unclear. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) is a well-established technique for evaluating the metabolic activity of the amygdala (AmygA), a crucial brain region involved in the response to chronic stress. We aimed to investigate the association between AmygA and lymph node (LN) metastasis in patients with endometrial cancer. In total, 161 patients with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer who received preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT were recruited. AmygA was calculated as the ratio of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the amygdala to the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) of the temporal lobe. Postmenopausal patients with positive LN metastasis had elevated AmygA levels and systemic inflammation markers, such as spleen and bone marrow SUVmax, compared to those without LN metastasis. Notably, AmygA was independently associated with LN metastasis in postmenopausal patients but not in premenopausal patients. Additionally, the correlation between AmygA and systemic inflammation markers was more pronounced in postmenopausal patients. AmygA is independently associated with LN metastasis status in postmenopausal endometrial cancer patients. Our findings suggest that neurobiological activity related to stress, particularly involving the amygdala, may be associated with tumor aggressiveness in postmenopausal endometrial cancer patients.","Endometrial cancer, Metastasis, Stress, Amygdala, Menopause, Positron-emission tomography"
Screening for oncogenic AF1q expression predicts disease recurrence in gastric cancer patients,"Elisabeth S. Gruber, Georg Oberhuber, Michaela Schlederer, Peter Birner, Gerd Jomrich, Sebastian F. Schoppmann, William Tse, Lukas Kenner",2024-07-10,"AF1q associates with tumor progression and metastases upon WNT signaling. The downstream WNT target CD44 has demonstrated prognostic significance in gastric cancer (GC). This study evaluates the impact of AF1q on tumor stage and survival in GC patients. Immunohistochemical marker expression was analyzed and data were processed to correlation and survival analysis. Out of 182 GC samples, 178 (97.8%) showed moderate to high AF1q expression (p < 0.001), these samples correlated with positive lymph node stage (p = 0.036). In a subgroup analysis of patients with nodal-positive GC (n = 129, 70.9%), enhanced tumoral AF1q expression resulted in impaired recurrence-free survival (RFS, p = 0.030). Enhanced tumoral CD44 expression resulted in impaired disease-specific survival (DSS) in the subgroup of patients with nodal-positive GC (p = 0.031) as well as in the overall GC group (p = 0.005). AF1q demonstrated as an independent prognostic marker for RFS (p = 0.035) and CD44 for DSS (p = 0.036). AF1q has shown potential for prognostication of RFS in GC patients and is predominantly expressed in nodal-positive GC. Testing AF1q provides a possibility of identifying patients with locoregional (and advanced) disease, particularly at risk for disease recurrence. Implementing AF1q into the diagnostic process may facilitate screening, prognosis estimation as well as consideration of preoperative multimodal treatment in patients qualifying for elective upfront surgery.","AF1q, CD44, Lymph node stage, Recurrence, Survival, Gastric cancer"
Impact of an online reference system on the diagnosis of rare or atypical abdominal tumors and lesions,"Matthias Michael Woeltjen, Julius Henning Niehoff, Saher Saeed, Alexander Mendorf, Ruth Roggel, Arwed Elias Michael, Alexey Surov, Christoph Moenninghoff, Jan Borggrefe, Jan Robert Kroeger",2024-07-10,"The purpose of the present study is to evaluate whether an online reference system (ORS, STATdx Elsevier, Amsterdam, Netherlands) impacts finding the histologically confirmed diagnosis of rare or atypical abdominal tumors and lesions in radiologic imaging. In total, 101 patients with rare tumor entities or lesions and atypical manifestations of common tumors were enrolled retrospectively. Blinded readings were performed by four radiologists with varying levels of experience, who reported on: (a) correct diagnosis (CD), (b) time needed to find the diagnosis, and (c) diagnostic confidence, initially without followed by the assistance of the ORS. The experienced reader (3 years of experience post-residency, CD 49.5%), as well as the advanced reader with 1 year of experience post-residency (CD 43.6%), and a resident with 5 years of experience (CD 46.5%) made the correct diagnosis more frequently compared to the less experienced reader (CD 25.7%). A significant improvement in making the correct diagnosis was only achieved by the advanced reader, the resident with 5 years of experience (CD with ORS 58.4%; p < 0.001). The advanced reader with 1 year of experience post-residency improved slightly (CD ORS 47.5%). The experienced reader (CD ORS 50.5%) and the less experienced reader (CD ORS 27.7%) did not improve significantly. The overall subjective confidence increased significantly when ORS was used (3.2 ± 0.9 vs. 3.8 ± 0.9; p < 0.001). While the ORS had a positive impact on making the correct diagnosis throughout all readers, it favored radiologists with more clinical experience rather than inexperienced residents. Moreover, the ORS increased the diagnostic confidence of all radiologists significantly. In conclusion, the ORS had no significant impact on the diagnosis of rare or atypical abdominal tumors and lesions except for one reader. The greatest benefit is the increase in diagnostic confidence.","Computed tomography, CT, Online reference system, ORS, STATdx, Diagnostic performance, Abdominal tumors"
Tumor-derived extracellular vesicles disrupt the blood–brain barrier endothelium following high-frequency irreversible electroporation,"Kelsey R. Murphy, Kenneth N. Aycock, Spencer Marsh, Alayna N.

Dervisis",2024-11-18,"High-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE), a nonthermal brain tumor ablation therapeutic, generates a central tumor ablation zone while transiently disrupting the peritumoral blood–brain barrier (BBB). We hypothesized that bystander effects of H-FIRE tumor cell ablation, mediated by small tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (sTDEV), disrupt the BBB endothelium. Monolayers of bEnd.3 cerebral endothelial cells were exposed to supernatants of H-FIRE or radiation (RT)-treated LL/2 and F98 cancer cells. Endothelial cell response was evaluated microscopically and via flow cytometry for apoptosis. sTDEV were isolated following H-FIRE and RT, characterized via nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and transmission electron microscopy, and applied to a Transwell BBB endothelium model to quantify permeability changes. Supernatants of H-FIRE-treated tumor cells, but not supernatants of sham- or RT-treated cells, disrupted endothelial cell monolayer integrity while maintaining viability. sTDEV released by glioma cells treated with 3000 V/cm H-FIRE increased permeability of the BBB endothelium model compared to sTDEV released after lower H-FIRE doses and RT. NTA revealed significantly decreased sTDEV release after the 3000 V/cm H-FIRE dose. Our results demonstrate that sTDEV increase permeability of the BBB endothelium after H-FIRE ablation in vitro. sTDEV-mediated mechanisms of BBB disruption may be exploited for drug delivery to infiltrative margins following H-FIRE ablation.",

Blast cells residing in the CNS but not circulating in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) remain undetected by current diagnostic methods, preventing a truly risk-adapted anti-leukemic treatment in this compartment. We examined the clinical applicability of the molecular marker microRNA (miR)-181a quantified in the cell-free CSF to evaluate the level of CNS involvement and to optimize patient stratification based on CNS status. Normalized copy number of miR-181a was longitudinally profiled using droplet digital PCR, and the results were compared with the degree of leukemic involvement of the CNS. After combining cytospin- and flow cytometry (FCM) data with miR-181a expression, we could stratify previously ambiguous cases and reclassify patients into a CNS-positive/miR-significant group (mean ± SE for miR-181a copies: 3300.70 ± 809.69) bearing remarkable infiltration as well as into CNS-minimal/miR-significant and CNS-minimal/miR-minimal groups differentiating putative, clinically significant occult CNSL cases (2503.50 ± 275.89 and 744.02 ± 86.81 copies, respectively, p = 1.13 × 10–6). In summary, miR-181a expression is a promising biomarker for CNSL detection, facilitating the robust identification of patients who could benefit from intensified CNS-directed therapy.","Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Cerebrospinal fluid, Diagnostics, MicroRNA, Molecular genetics"
Construction of molecular subtype and prognostic model for gastric cancer based on nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes,"Xu Wang, Sainan Li, Yuhuan Shen, Li Cao, Yajuan Lu, Jinghao Cao, Yingchao Liu, Aoli Deng, Jiyun Yang, Tongtong Wang",2024-11-18,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a common digestive system cancer, characterized by a significant mortality rate. Mitochondria is an indispensable organelle in eukaryotic cells. It was previously revealed that a series of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes (NMG) mutations and dysfunctions potentially contribute to the initiation and progression of GC. However, the correlation between NMG mutations and survival outcomes for GC patients is still unclear. In this study, NMG expression profile and clinical information in GC samples were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Through consistent clustering and functional enrichment analysis, we have identified three NMG clusters and three gene clusters that are associated with patterns of immune cell infiltration. Prognostic genes were identified through Univariate Cox regression analysis. The principal component analysis was conducted to set up a scoring system. Subsequently, the Single‑cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of GC patients and cancer cell drug sensitivity data were retrieved from the GEO database. Patients with high NMG scores exhibited increased microsatellite instability status and a heightened tumor mutation rate compared to those with low NMG scores. Survival analysis revealed that GC samples with high NMG scores could achieve a better prognosis. Additionally, These patients were observed to be more responsive to immunotherapy. Moreover, we delved into prognostic genes at the level of single cells, revealing that MRPL4 and MRPL37 exhibit high expression in epithelial cells, while TPM1 demonstrates high expression in tissue stem cells. Utilizing cancer cell drug sensitivity data from the Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database, we noted a heightened sensitivity to chemotherapy in the high NMG group. Furthermore, we discovered a significant enrichment of cuproptosis-related genes in clusters with high NMG scores. Consequently, employing the scoring system could facilitate the prediction of GC patients’ sensitivity to cuproptosis-induced therapy. Our study confirmed the potency of this scoring system as a therapeutic response biomarker for gastric cancer, potentially informing clinical treatment strategies.","Gastric cancer, Nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes, Tumor microenvironment, Tumor mutational burden, Immunotherapy"
Evaluation of cosmetic outcomes in breast reconstruction patients undergoing radiotherapy using an anomaly generative adversarial network model,"Choong-won Lee, Kyung Hwan Shin, Ji Hyun Chang, Bum-Sup Jang",2024-07-10,"Considering the rising prevalence of breast reconstruction followed by radiotherapy (RT), evaluating the cosmetic impact of RT is crucial. Currently, there are limited tools for objectively assessing cosmetic outcomes in patients who have undergone reconstruction. Therefore, we validated the cosmetic outcome using a previously developed anomaly Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model and evaluated its utility. Between January 2016 and December 2020, we collected computed tomography (CT) images from 82 breast cancer patients who underwent immediate reconstruction surgery followed by radiotherapy. Among these patients, 38 received immediate implant insertion, while 44 underwent autologous breast reconstruction. Anomaly scores (AS) were estimated using an anomaly GAN model at pre-RT, 1st follow-up, 1-year (Post-1Y) and 2-year (Post-2Y) after RT. Subsequently, the scores were analyzed in a time-series manner, considering reconstruction types (implant versus autologous), RT techniques, and the incidence of major complications. The median age of the patients was 46 years (range 29–62). The AS between Post-1Y and Post-2Y demonstrated a positive relationship (coefficient 0.515, P < 0.001). The AS was significantly associated with objective cosmetic indices, namely Breast Contour Difference (P = 0.009) and Breast Area Difference (P = 0.004), at both Post-1Y and Post-2Y. Subgroup analysis stratified by type of breast reconstruction revealed significantly higher AS values in patients who underwent prosthetic implant insertion compared to those with autologous reconstruction at all follow-up time points (1st follow-up, P = 0.001; Post-1Y, P < 0.001; and Post-2Y, P < 0.001). A threshold AS of ≥ 1.9 was associated with a 10% predicted risk of developing major complications. The feasibility of an AS generated by a GAN model for predicting both cosmetic outcomes and the likelihood of complications following RT has been successfully validated. Further investigation involving a larger patient cohort is warranted.",

Tumour biopsies were collected pre-treatment, during single-agent rucaparib run-in, and after starting combination therapy.ResultsThe most common adverse events with rucaparib 600 mg twice daily and atezolizumab 1200 mg on Day 1 every 3 weeks were gastrointestinal effects, fatigue, liver enzyme elevations, and anaemia. Responding patients typically had BRCA-mutated tumours and higher pre-treatment tumour levels of PD-L1 and CD8 + T cells. Markers of DNA damage repair decreased during rucaparib run-in and combination treatment in responders, but typically increased in non-responders. Apoptosis signature expression showed the reverse. CD8 + T-cell activity and STING pathway activation increased during rucaparib run-in, increasing further with atezolizumab.ConclusionsIn this small study, rucaparib plus atezolizumab demonstrated acceptable safety and activity in BRCA-mutated tumours. Increasing anti-tumour immunity and inflammation might be a key mechanism of action for clinical benefit from the combination, potentially guiding more targeted development of such regimens.Clinical trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03101280).",

"Exploring the genetic associations and causal relationships between antibody responses, immune cells, and various types of breast cancer","Yang Yang, Jiayi Chen, Fuhong Gong, Jingge Miao, Mengping Lin, Ruimin Liu, Chenxi Wang, Fei Ge, Wenlin Chen",2024-11-19,"Background: There may be potential associations between various pathogens, antibody immune responses, and breast cancer (BC), but the specific mechanisms and causal relationships remain unclear. Methods: First, multiple Mendelian randomization (MR) methods were used for univariable MR analysis to explore potential causal relationships between 34 antibody immune responses (related to 12 pathogens), 46 antibody immune responses (related to 13 pathogens), antibody responses post-COVID-19 vaccination, 731 immune cell types, and various BC subtypes (including overall BC, ER-positive, ER-negative, Luminal A, Luminal B, Luminal B HER2-negative, HER2-positive, and triple-negative BC). The primary results were then subjected to reverse MR analysis, heterogeneity testing using Cochran’s Q, and horizontal pleiotropy testing. Robust findings were further used to design mediation pathways involving antibody immune responses, immune cells, and BC. After adjusting the effect estimates using multivariable MR (MVMR), a two-step mediation analysis was conducted to explore mediation pathways and mediation proportions. Finally, linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was applied to analyze the genetic correlation between phenotypes along mediation pathways, and cross-phenotype association analysis (CPASSOC) was performed to identify pleiotropic SNPs among three phenotypes along these pathways. Bayesian colocalization tests were conducted on pleiotropic SNPs using the multiple-trait-coloc (moloc). Results: We identified potential causal relationships between 15 antibody immune responses to 8 pathogens (Hepatitis B virus, Herpes Simplex Virus 2, Human Herpesvirus 6, Polyomavirus 2, BK polyomavirus, Cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia trachomatis), 250 immune cell phenotypes, and various BC subtypes. MVMR-adjusted mediation analysis revealed four potential mediation pathways. LDSC results showed no significant genetic correlation between phenotypes pairwise. CPASSOC analysis identified two potential mediation pathways with common pleiotropic SNPs (rs12121677, rs281378, rs2894250). However, none of these SNPs passed the Bayesian colocalization test by moloc. These results excluded horizontal pleiotropy, stabilizing MR analysis results. Conclusion: This study utilized MR methods to analyze potential causal relationships between various antibody immune responses, immune cell types, and BC subtypes, identifying four potential regulatory mediation pathways. The findings of this study offer potential targets and research directions for virus-related and immunotherapy-related studies, providing a certain level of theoretical support. However, limitations such as GWAS sample size constraints and unclear specific pathophysiological mechanisms need further improvement and validation in future studies.","Breast cancer, Pathogen, Virus, Antibody immune response, Causal inference, Mediation analysis, Genetic correlation"

Neratinib, an irreversible, pan-HER, oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, interferes with constitutive receptor kinase activation and has activity in HER2-mutant tumours. SUMMIT is an open-label, single-arm, multi-cohort, phase 2, ‘basket’ trial of neratinib in patients with solid tumours harbouring oncogenic HER2 somatic mutations (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01953926). The primary objective of the BTC cohort, which is now complete, is first objective response rate (ORR) to neratinib 240 mg orally daily. Secondary objectives include confirmed ORR, clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, duration of response, overall survival, safety and tolerability. Genomic analyses were exploratory. Among 25 treatment-refractory patients (11 cholangiocarcinoma, 10 gallbladder, 4 ampullary cancers), the ORR is 16% (95% CI 4.5–36.1%). The most common HER2 mutations are S310F (n = 11; 48%) and V777L (n = 4; 17%). Outcomes appear worse for ampullary tumours or those with co-occurring oncogenic TP53 and CDKN2A alterations. Loss of amplified HER2 S310F and acquisition of multiple previously undetected oncogenic co-mutations are identified at progression in one responder. Diarrhoea is the most common adverse event, with any-grade diarrhoea in 14 patients (56%). Although neratinib demonstrates antitumour activity in patients with refractory BTC harbouring HER2 mutations, the primary endpoint was not met and combinations may be explored.",
Nomogram development for predicting ovarian tumor malignancy using inflammatory biomarker and CA-125,"Gatot Nyarumenteng Adhipurnawan Winarno, Ali Budi Harsono, Dodi Suardi, Siti Salima, Kemala Isnainiasih Mantilidewi, Hartanto Bayuaji, Ayu Insafi Mulyantari, Fajar Awalia Yulianto, Hadi Susiarno",2024-07-09,"Global challenges in ovarian cancer underscore the need for cost-effective screening. This study aims to assess the role of pretreatment Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte-Ratio (LMR), Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), and CA-125 in distinguishing benign and malignant ovarian tumors, while also constructing nomogram models for distinguish benign and malignant ovarian tumor using inflammatory biomarkers and CA-125. This is a retrospective study of 206 ovarian tumor patients. We conducted bivariate analysis to compare mean values of CA-125, LMR, NLR, and PLR with histopathology results. Multiple regression logistic analysis was then employed to establish predictive models for malignancy. NLR, PLR, and CA-125 exhibited statistically higher levels in malignant ovarian tumors compared to benign ones (5.56 ± 4.8 vs. 2.9 ± 2.58, 278.12 ± 165.2 vs. 180.64 ± 89.95, 537.2 ± 1621.47 vs. 110.08 ± 393.05, respectively), while lower LMR was associated with malignant tumors compared to benign (3.2 ± 1.6 vs. 4.24 ± 1.78, p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that both PLR and CA125 emerged as independent risk factors for malignancy in ovarian tumors (P(z) 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Utilizing the outcomes of multiple regression logistic analysis, a nomogram was constructed to enhance malignancy prediction in ovarian tumors. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the significance of NLR, PLR, CA-125, and LMR in diagnosing ovarian tumors. PLR and CA-125 emerged as independent risk factors for distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. The nomogram model offers a practical way to enhance diagnostic precision.","Ovarian tumors, Ovarian cancer, Inflammatory biomarker, CA125"
Anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptors with fully human heavy-chain-only antigen recognition domains,"Norris Lam, Nathan D. Trinklein, Benjamin Buelow, George H. Patterson, Namrata Ojha, James N. Kochenderfer",2020-01-15,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells targeting B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) have activity against multiple myeloma, but improvements in anti-BCMA CARs are needed. We demonstrated recipient anti-CAR T-cell responses against a murine single-chain variable fragment (scFv) used clinically in anti-BCMA CARs. To bypass potential anti-CAR immunogenicity and to reduce CAR binding domain size, here we designed CARs with antigen-recognition domains consisting of only a fully human heavy-chain variable domain without a light-chain domain. A CAR designated FHVH33-CD8BBZ contains a fully human heavy-chain variable domain (FHVH) plus 4-1BB and CD3ζ domains. T cells expressing FHVH33-CD8BBZ exhibit similar cytokine release, degranulation, and mouse tumor eradication as a CAR that is identical except for substitution of a scFv for FHVH33. Inclusion of 4-1BB is critical for reducing activation-induced cell death and promoting survival of T cells expressing FHVH33-containing CARs. Our results indicate that heavy-chain-only anti-BCMA CARs are suitable for evaluation in a clinical trial.",
Dual blockade of CD47 and HER2 eliminates radioresistant breast cancer cells,"Demet Candas-Green, Bowen Xie, Jie Huang, Ming Fan, Aijun Wang, Cheikh Menaa, Yanhong Zhang, Lu Zhang, Di Jing, Soheila Azghadi, Weibing Zhou, Lin Liu, Nian Jiang, Tao Li, Tianyi Gao, Colleen Sweeney, Rulong Shen, Tzu-yin Lin, Chong-xian Pan, Omer M.

Weichselbaum, Jian Jian Li",2020-09-14,"Although the efficacy of cancer radiotherapy (RT) can be enhanced by targeted immunotherapy, the immunosuppressive factors induced by radiation on tumor cells remain to be identified. Here, we report that CD47-mediated anti-phagocytosis is concurrently upregulated with HER2 in radioresistant breast cancer (BC) cells and RT-treated mouse syngeneic BC. Co-expression of both receptors is more frequently detected in recurrent BC patients with poor prognosis. CD47 is upregulated preferentially in HER2-expressing cells, and blocking CD47 or HER2 reduces both receptors with diminished clonogenicity and augmented phagocytosis. CRISPR-mediated CD47 and HER2 dual knockouts not only inhibit clonogenicity but also enhance macrophage-mediated attack. Dual antibody of both receptors synergizes with RT in control of syngeneic mouse breast tumor. These results provide the evidence that aggressive behavior of radioresistant BC is caused by CD47-mediated anti-phagocytosis conjugated with HER2-prompted proliferation. Dual blockade of CD47 and HER2 is suggested to eliminate resistant cancer cells in BC radiotherapy.",
A VEGF receptor vaccine demonstrates preliminary efficacy in neurofibromatosis type 2,"Ryota Tamura, Masato Fujioka, Yukina Morimoto, Kentaro Ohara, Kenzo Kosugi, Yumiko Oishi, Mizuto Sato, Ryo Ueda, Hirokazu Fujiwara, Tetsuro Hikichi, Shinobu Noji, Naoki Oishi, Kaoru Ogawa, Yutaka Kawakami, Takayuki Ohira, Kazunari Yoshida, Masahiro Toda",2019-12-17,"The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab has shown efficacy for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Theoretically, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill both tumor vessel cells and tumor cells expressing VEGFRs. Here we show an exploratory clinical study of VEGFRs peptide vaccine in seven patients with progressive NF2-derived schwannomas. Hearing improves in 2/5 assessable patients (40%) as determined by international guidelines, with increases in word recognition scores. Tumor volume reductions of ≥20% are observed in two patients, including one in which bevacizumab had not been effective. There are no severe adverse events related to the vaccine. Both VEGFR1-specific and VEGFR2-specific CTLs are induced in six patients. Surgery is performed after vaccination in two patients, and significant reductions in the expression of VEGFRs in schwannomas are observed. Therefore, this clinical immunotherapy study demonstrates the safety and preliminary efficacy of VEGFRs peptide vaccination in patients with NF2.",
Bispecific CAR T cell therapy targeting BCMA and CD19 in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: a phase I/II trial,"Ming Shi, Jiaojiao Wang, Hongming Huang, Dan Liu, Hai Cheng, Xu Wang, Wei Chen, Zhiling Yan, Wei Sang, Kunming Qi, Depeng Li, Feng Zhu, Zhenyu Li, Jianlin Qiao, Qingyun Wu, Lingyu Zeng, Xiaoming Fei, Weiying Gu, Yuqing Miao, Kailin Xu, Junnian Zheng, Jiang Cao",2024-04-20,"Despite the high therapeutic response achieved with B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (R/R MM), primary resistance and relapse exist with single-target immunotherapy. Here, we design bispecific BC19 CAR T cells targeting BCMA/CD19 and evaluate antimyeloma activity in vitro and in vivo. Preclinical results indicate that BC19 CAR specifically recognize target antigens, and BC19 CAR T cells mediate selective killing of BCMA or CD19-positive cancer cells. BC19 CAR T cells also exhibit potent antigen-specific anti-tumor activity in xenograft mouse models. We conduct an open-label, single-arm, phase I/II study of BC19 CAR T cells in 50 patients with R/R MM (ChiCTR2000033567). The primary endpoint was safety. BC19 CAR T cells are well tolerated with grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome in 8% of patients and grade 1 neurotoxic events in 4% of patients, which meet the pre-specified primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate (92%), median progression-free survival (19.7 months), median overall survival (19.7 months) and median duration of response (not reached). Our study demonstrates that bispecific BC19 CAR T cells are feasible, safe and effective in treating patients with R/R MM.",
AKT-induced lncRNA VAL promotes EMT-independent metastasis through diminishing Trim16-dependent Vimentin degradation,"Han Tian, Rong Lian, Yun Li, Chenying Liu, Shujun Liang, Wei Li, Tianyu Tao, Xingui Wu, Yaokai Ye, Xia Yang, Jian Han, Xuwei Chen, Jun Li, Yukai He, Mengfeng Li, Jueheng Wu, Junchao Cai",2020-10-12,"Despite the importance of AKT overactivation in tumor progression, results from clinical trials of various AKT inhibitors remain suboptimal, suggesting that AKT-driven tumor metastasis needs to be further understood. Herein, based on long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) profiling induced by active AKT, we identify that VAL (Vimentin associated lncRNA, LINC01546), which is directly induced by AKT/STAT3 signaling, functions as a potent pro-metastatic molecule and is essential for active AKT-induced tumor invasion, metastasis and anoikis resistance in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). Impressively, chemosynthetic siRNAs against VAL shows great therapeutic potential in AKT overactivation-driven metastasis. Interestingly, similar to activated AKT in LAD cells, although unable to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), VAL exerts potent pro-invasive and pro-metastatic effects through directly binding to Vimentin and competitively abrogating Trim16-depedent Vimentin polyubiquitination and degradation. Taken together, our study provides an interesting demonstration of a lncRNA-mediated mechanism for active AKT-driven EMT-independent LAD metastasis and indicates the great potential of targeting VAL or Vimentin stability as a therapeutic approach.",
CD73 on cancer-associated fibroblasts enhanced by the A2B-mediated feedforward circuit enforces an immune checkpoint,"Miao Yu, Gang Guo, Lei Huang, Libin Deng, Chang-Sheng Chang, Bhagelu R. Achyut, Madison Canning, Ningchun Xu, Ali S. Arbab, Roni J. Bollag, Paulo C. Rodriguez, Andrew L. Mellor, Huidong Shi, David H. Munn, Yan Cui",2020-01-24,"CD73, an ecto-5′-nucleotidase (NT5E), serves as an immune checkpoint by generating adenosine (ADO), which suppresses immune activation through the A2A receptor. Elevated CD73 levels in tumor tissues correlate with poor clinical outcomes. However, the crucial source of CD73 activity within the tumor microenvironment remains unspecified. Here, we demonstrate that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute the prominent CD73hi population in human colorectal cancers (CRCs) and two CD73− murine tumor models, including a modified CRC. Clinically, high CAF abundancy in CRC tissues correlates strongly with elevated CD73 activity and poor prognosis. Mechanistically, CAF-CD73 expression is enhanced via an ADO-A2B receptor-mediated feedforward circuit triggered by tumor cell death, which enforces the CD73-checkpoint. Simultaneous inhibition of A2A and A2B pathways with CD73-neutralization synergistically enhances antitumor immunity in CAF-rich tumors. Therefore, the strategic and effective targeting of both the A2B-mediated ADO-CAF-CD73 feedforward circuit and A2A-mediated immune suppression is crucial for improving therapeutic outcomes.",
NPM1 upregulates the transcription of PD-L1 and suppresses T cell activity in triple-negative breast cancer,"Ge Qin, Xin Wang, Shubiao Ye, Yizhuo Li, Miao Chen, Shusen Wang, Tao Qin, Changlin Zhang, Yixin Li, Qian Long, Huabin Hu, Dingbo Shi, Jiaping Li, Kai Zhang, Qinglian Zhai, Yanlai Tang, Tiebang Kang, Ping Lan, Fangyun Xie, Jianjun Lu, Wuguo Deng",2020-04-03,"Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) interaction plays a crucial role in tumor-associated immune escape. Here, we verify that triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has higher PD-L1 expression than other subtypes. We then discover that nucleophosmin (NPM1) binds to PD-L1 promoter specifically in TNBC cells and activates PD-L1 transcription, thus inhibiting T cell activity in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PARP1 suppresses PD-L1 transcription through its interaction with the nucleic acid binding domain of NPM1, which is required for the binding of NPM1 at PD-L1 promoter. Consistently, the PARP1 inhibitor olaparib elevates PD-L1 expression in TNBC and exerts a better effect with anti-PD-L1 therapy. Together, our research has revealed NPM1 as a transcription regulator of PD-L1 in TNBC, which could lead to potential therapeutic strategies to enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.",
Boosting anti-PD-1 therapy with metformin-loaded macrophage-derived microparticles,"Zhaohan Wei, Xiaoqiong Zhang, Tuying Yong, Nana Bie, Guiting Zhan, Xin Li, Qingle Liang, Jianye Li, Jingjing Yu, Gang Huang, Yuchen Yan, Zelong Zhang, Bixiang Zhang, Lu Gan, Bo Huang, Xiangliang Yang",2021-01-19,"The main challenges for programmed cell death 1(PD-1)/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) checkpoint blockade lie in a lack of sufficient T cell infiltration, tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, and the inadequate tumor accumulation and penetration of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody. Resetting tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is a promising strategy to enhance T-cell antitumor immunity and ameliorate tumor immunosuppression. Here, mannose-modified macrophage-derived microparticles (Man-MPs) loading metformin (Met@Man-MPs) are developed to efficiently target to M2-like TAMs to repolarize into M1-like phenotype. Met@Man-MPs-reset TAMs remodel the tumor immune microenvironment by increasing the recruitment of CD8+ T cells into tumor tissues and decreasing immunosuppressive infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells. More importantly, the collagen-degrading capacity of Man-MPs contributes to the infiltration of CD8+ T cells into tumor interiors and enhances tumor accumulation and penetration of anti-PD-1 antibody. These unique features of Met@Man-MPs contribute to boost anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, improving anticancer efficacy and long-term memory immunity after combination treatment. Our results support Met@Man-MPs as a potential drug to improve tumor resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy.",

Here we adapt the HyperTRIBE method using an RBP fused to a Drosophila RNA editing enzyme (ADAR) to globally map the mRNA targets of the RBP MSI2 in mammalian adult normal and malignant stem cells. We reveal a unique MUSASHI-2 (MSI2) mRNA binding network in hematopoietic stem cells that changes during transition to multipotent progenitors. Additionally, we discover a significant increase in RNA binding activity of MSI2 in leukemic stem cells compared with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, resulting in selective regulation of MSI2’s oncogenic targets. This provides a basis for MSI2 increased dependency in leukemia cells compared to normal cells. Moreover, our study provides a way to measure RBP function in rare cells and suggests that RBPs can achieve differential binding activity during cell state transition independent of gene expression.",

We randomized 131 patients with HER2-negative stage II/III breast cancer, without diabetes and a BMI over 18 kg m−2, to receive either a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) or their regular diet for 3 days prior to and during neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Here we show that there was no difference in toxicity between both groups, despite the fact that dexamethasone was omitted in the FMD group. A radiologically complete or partial response occurs more often in patients using the FMD (OR 3.168, P = 0.039). Moreover, per-protocol analysis reveals that the Miller&Payne 4/5 pathological response, indicating 90–100% tumor-cell loss, is more likely to occur in patients using the FMD (OR 4.109, P = 0.016). Also, the FMD significantly curtails chemotherapy-induced DNA damage in T-lymphocytes. These positive findings encourage further exploration of the benefits of fasting/FMD in cancer therapy.

Cytology identifies 91 endometrial, two fallopian tube and one cervical cancer from 103 known cancer cases. In women with unexplained postmenopausal bleeding, cytology identifies all four endometrial cancers and three others (cervical, ovarian and bladder), for a 12/107 (11.2%) false positive rate. We show proof-of-principle that endometrial cancer can be detected in urine and vaginal fluid. Prospective validation of these findings will support incorporation of this non-invasive test into clinical practice.",

Models demonstrate high genomic concordance with the corresponding patient tumors, with invasive tumors more likely to successfully engraft. Treatment of PDX models with chemotherapy recapitulates responses observed in patients. Analysis of a HER2 S310F-mutant PDX suggests that an antibody drug conjugate targeting HER2 would have superior efficacy versus selective HER2 kinase inhibitors. In sum, the biological and phenotypic concordance between patient and PDXs suggest that these models could facilitate studies of intrinsic and acquired resistance and the development of personalized medicine strategies for UTUC patients.",

Here, we describe ExtraCRAd, a multi-vaccination strategy focused on an oncolytic virus artificially wrapped with tumor cancer membranes carrying tumor antigens. We demonstrate that ExtraCRAd displays increased infectivity and oncolytic effect in vitro and in vivo. We show that this nanoparticle platform controls the growth of aggressive melanoma and lung tumors in vivo both in preventive and therapeutic setting, creating a highly specific anti-cancer immune response. In conclusion, ExtraCRAd might serve as the next generation of personalized cancer vaccines with enhanced features over standard vaccination regimens, representing an alternative way to target cancer.",
Therapeutic modulation of phagocytosis in glioblastoma can activate both innate and adaptive antitumour immunity,"Christina A. von Roemeling, Yifan Wang, Yaqing Qie, Hengfeng Yuan, Hai Zhao, Xiujie Liu, Zhaogang Yang, Mingming Yang, Weiye Deng, Katelyn A.

Kim",2020-03-20,"Tumour cell phagocytosis by antigen presenting cells (APCs) is critical to the generation of antitumour immunity. However, cancer cells can evade phagocytosis by upregulating anti-phagocytosis molecule CD47. Here, we show that CD47 blockade alone is inefficient in stimulating glioma cell phagocytosis. However, combining CD47 blockade with temozolomide results in a significant pro-phagocytosis effect due to the latter’s ability to induce endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Increased tumour cell phagocytosis subsequently enhances antigen cross-presentation and activation of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING) in APCs, resulting in more efficient T cell priming. This bridging of innate and adaptive responses inhibits glioma growth, but also activates immune checkpoint. Sequential administration of an anti-PD1 antibody overcomes this potential adaptive resistance. Together, these findings reveal a dynamic relationship between innate and adaptive immune regulation in tumours and support further investigation of phagocytosis modulation as a strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapy responses.",

Diskin, Mark Zimmerman, Javed Khan, Berkley Gryder, Carol J. Thiele",2024-04-23,"Temporal regulation of super-enhancer (SE) driven transcription factors (TFs) underlies normal developmental programs. Neuroblastoma (NB) arises from an inability of sympathoadrenal progenitors to exit a self-renewal program and terminally differentiate. To identify SEs driving TF regulators, we use all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to induce NB growth arrest and differentiation. Time-course H3K27ac ChIP-seq and RNA-seq reveal ATRA coordinated SE waves. SEs that decrease with ATRA link to stem cell development (MYCN, GATA3, SOX11). CRISPR-Cas9 and siRNA verify SOX11 dependency, in vitro and in vivo. Silencing the SOX11 SE using dCAS9-KRAB decreases SOX11 mRNA and inhibits cell growth. Other TFs activate in sequential waves at 2, 4 and 8 days of ATRA treatment that regulate neural development (GATA2 and SOX4). Silencing the gained SOX4 SE using dCAS9-KRAB decreases SOX4 expression and attenuates ATRA-induced differentiation genes.

We identify two determinants of response; mutational signature 3 reflecting defective homologous recombination DNA repair, and positive immune score as a surrogate of interferon-primed exhausted CD8 + T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. Presence of one or both features associates with an improved outcome while concurrent absence yields no responses. Single-cell spatial analysis reveals prominent interactions of exhausted CD8 + T-cells and PD-L1 + macrophages and PD-L1 + tumor cells as mechanistic determinants of response. Furthermore, spatial analysis of two extreme responders shows differential clustering of exhausted CD8 + T-cells with PD-L1 + macrophages in the first, and exhausted CD8 + T-cells with cancer cells harboring genomic PD-L1 and PD-L2 amplification in the second.",

Wong, Mototsugu Oya, Donald Kufe",2020-01-17,"Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is an aggressive malignancy with no effective targeted therapies. The oncogenic MUC1-C protein is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and NEPC, but its specific role is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that upregulation of MUC1-C in androgen-dependent PC cells suppresses androgen receptor (AR) axis signaling and induces the neural BRN2 transcription factor. MUC1-C activates a MYC→BRN2 pathway in association with induction of MYCN, EZH2 and NE differentiation markers (ASCL1, AURKA and SYP) linked to NEPC progression. Moreover, MUC1-C suppresses the p53 pathway, induces the Yamanaka pluripotency factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC) and drives stemness. Targeting MUC1-C decreases PC self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for CRPC and NEPC. In PC tissues, MUC1 expression associates with suppression of AR signaling and increases in BRN2 expression and NEPC score. These results highlight MUC1-C as a master effector of lineage plasticity driving progression to NEPC.",
Primary prophylaxis with mTOR inhibitor enhances T cell effector function and prevents heart transplant rejection during talimogene laherparepvec therapy of squamous cell carcinoma,"Victor Joo, Karim Abdelhamid, Alessandra Noto, Sofiya Latifyan, Federica Martina, Douglas Daoudlarian, Rita De Micheli, Menno Pruijm, Solange Peters, Roger Hullin, Olivier Gaide, Giuseppe Pantaleo, Michel Obeid",2024-04-30,"The application of mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition (mTORi) as primary prophylactic therapy to optimize T cell effector function while preserving allograft tolerance remains challenging. Here, we present a comprehensive two-step therapeutic approach in a male patient with metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and heart transplantation followed with concomitant longitudinal analysis of systemic immunologic changes. In the first step, calcineurin inhibitor/ mycophenolic acid is replaced by the mTORi everolimus to achieve an improved effector T cell status with increased cytotoxic activity (perforin, granzyme), enhanced proliferation (Ki67) and upregulated activation markers (CD38, CD69). In the second step, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) injection further enhances effector function by switching CD4 and CD8 cells from central memory to effector memory profiles, enhancing Th1 responses, and boosting cytotoxic and proliferative activities. In addition, cytokine release (IL-6, IL-18, sCD25, CCL-2, CCL-4) is enhanced and the frequency of circulating regulatory T cells is increased. Notably, no histologic signs of allograft rejection are observed in consecutive end-myocardial biopsies. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of T cell activation and differentiation and suggest that timely initiation of mTORi-based primary prophylaxis may provide a dual benefit of revitalizing T cell function while maintaining allograft tolerance.",

One or more P/LP variants were found in 18% (138/751) of individuals when including variants in low-, moderate- and high-penetrance dominant or recessive genes or in 13% (99/751) of individuals in moderate- and high-penetrance dominant genes. Thirty-four percent of high- or moderate-penetrance variants were unexpected based on the patient’s diagnosis and previous history. Seventy-six percent of patients with positive results completed a clinical genetics visit, and 21% had at least one relative undergo cascade testing as a result of this testing. Clinical actionability additionally included screening, risk reduction in relatives, reproductive use and targeted therapies. Germline testing should be considered for all children with cancer.",
The MAO inhibitors phenelzine and clorgyline revert enzalutamide resistance in castration resistant prostate cancer,"Keliang Wang, Jie Luo, Shuyuan Yeh, Bosen You, Jialin Meng, Philip Chang, Yuanjie Niu, Gonghui Li, Changxue Lu, Yezi Zhu, Emmanuel S. Antonarakis, Jun Luo, Chi-Ping Huang, Wanhai Xu, Chawnshang Chang",2020-06-01,"The antiandrogen enzalutamide (Enz) has improved survival in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. However, most patients eventually develop Enz resistance that may involve inducing the androgen receptor (AR) splicing variant 7 (ARv7). Here we report that high expression of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) is associated with positive ARv7 detection in CRPC patients following Enz treatment. Targeting MAO-A with phenelzine or clorgyline, the FDA-approved drugs for antidepression, resensitize the Enz resistant (EnzR) cells to Enz treatment and further suppress EnzR cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that Enz-increased ARv7 expression can transcriptionally enhance MAO-A expression resulting in Enz resistance via altering the hypoxia HIF-1α signals. Together, our results show that targeting the Enz/ARv7/MAO-A signaling with the antidepressants phenelzine or clorgyline can restore Enz sensitivity to suppress EnzR cell growth, which may indicate that these antidepression drugs can overcome the Enz resistance to further suppress the EnzR CRPC.",
Pancreatic circulating tumor cell profiling identifies LIN28B as a metastasis driver and drug target,"Joseph W.

Characterization of rare, heterogeneous circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can provide insight into metastasis and guide development of novel therapies. Using the CTC-iChip to purify CTCs from PDAC patients for RNA-seq characterization, we identify three major correlated gene sets, with stemness genes LIN28B/KLF4, WNT5A, and LGALS3 enriched in each correlated gene set; only LIN28B CTC expression was prognostic. CRISPR knockout of LIN28B—an oncofetal RNA-binding protein exerting diverse effects via negative regulation of let-7 miRNAs and other RNA targets—in cell and animal models confers a less aggressive/metastatic phenotype. This correlates with de-repression of let-7 miRNAs and is mimicked by silencing of downstream let-7 target HMGA2 or chemical inhibition of LIN28B/let-7 binding. Molecular characterization of CTCs provides a unique opportunity to correlated gene set metastatic profiles, identify drivers of dissemination, and develop therapies targeting the “seeds” of metastasis.",
YAP1 mediates survival of ALK-rearranged lung cancer cells treated with alectinib via pro-apoptotic protein regulation,"Takahiro Tsuji, Hiroaki Ozasa, Wataru Aoki, Shunsuke Aburaya, Tomoko Yamamoto Funazo, Koh Furugaki, Yasushi Yoshimura, Masatoshi Yamazoe, Hitomi Ajimizu, Yuto Yasuda, Takashi Nomizo, Hironori Yoshida, Yuichi Sakamori, Hiroaki Wake, Mitsuyoshi Ueda, Young Hak Kim, Toyohiro Hirai",2020-01-03,"Despite the promising clinical efficacy of the second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor alectinib in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer, some tumor cells survive and eventually relapse, which may be an obstacle to achieving a cure. Limited information is currently available on the mechanisms underlying the initial survival of tumor cells against alectinib. Using patient-derived cell line models, we herein demonstrate that cancer cells survive a treatment with alectinib by activating Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), which mediates the expression of the anti-apoptosis factors Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL, and combinatorial inhibition against both YAP1 and ALK provides a longer tumor remission in ALK-rearranged xenografts when compared with alectinib monotherapy. These results suggest that the inhibition of YAP1 is a candidate for combinatorial therapy with ALK inhibitors to achieve complete remission in patients with ALK-rearranged lung cancer.",
An individualized protein-based prognostic model to stratify pediatric patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma,"Zhihong Wang, He Wang, Yan Zhou, Lu Li, Mengge Lyu, Chunlong Wu, Tianen He, Lingling Tan, Yi Zhu, Tiannan Guo, Hongkun Wu, Hao Zhang, Yaoting Sun",2024-04-26,"Pediatric papillary thyroid carcinomas (PPTCs) exhibit high inter-tumor heterogeneity and currently lack widely adopted recurrence risk stratification criteria.

We find 243 and 121 significantly dysregulated proteins from PM vs. PB and PM vs. AM, respectively. Function and pathway analyses show the enhanced activation of the inflammatory and immune system in PM patients compared with the others. Nineteen proteins are selected to predict recurrence using a machine learning model with an accuracy of 88.24%.

The global burden of lung cancer: current status and future trends,"Amanda Leiter, Rajwanth R. Veluswamy, Juan P. Wisnivesky",2023-07-21,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. However, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates differ substantially across the world, reflecting varying patterns of tobacco smoking, exposure to environmental risk factors and genetics. Tobacco smoking is the leading risk factor for lung cancer. Lung cancer incidence largely reflects trends in smoking patterns, which generally vary by sex and economic development. For this reason, tobacco control campaigns are a central part of global strategies designed to reduce lung cancer mortality. Environmental and occupational lung cancer risk factors, such as unprocessed biomass fuels, asbestos, arsenic and radon, can also contribute to lung cancer incidence in certain parts of the world. Over the past decade, large-cohort clinical studies have established that low-dose CT screening reduces lung cancer mortality, largely owing to increased diagnosis and treatment at earlier disease stages. These data have led to recommendations that individuals with a high risk of lung cancer undergo screening in several economically developed countries and increased implementation of screening worldwide. In this Review, we provide an overview of the global epidemiology of lung cancer. Lung cancer risk factors and global risk reduction efforts are also discussed. Finally, we summarize lung cancer screening policies and their implementation worldwide.",
Evaluation of computed tomography artefacts of carbon-fiber and titanium implants in patients with spinal oligometastatic disease undergoing stereotactic ablative radiotherapy,"Zeger Rijs, Khandkar Ali Kawsar, Priyanshu Saha, Michiel van de Sande, Darren Lui",2024-03-20,"This study evaluated artefacts on computed tomography (CT) images using Hounsfield units (HU) in patients with spinal oligometastatic disease who received carbon-fiber (CF; n = 11) or titanium (n = 11) spine implants and underwent stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Pre- and postoperative HU were measured at the vertebral body, pedicle, and spinal cord at three different levels: the lower instrumented vertebra, the level of metastatic spinal cord compression, and an uninvolved level. Areas measured at each level were delicately matched pre- and postoperatively. Significant differences in HU were observed at the vertebral body, the pedicle, and the spinal cord at the lowest instrumented vertebra level for both CF and titanium (average increase 1.54-fold and 5.11-fold respectively). At the metastatic spinal cord compression level, a trend towards a higher HU-increase was observed in titanium compared with CF treated patients (average increase 2.51-fold and 1.43-fold respectively). The relatively high postoperative HU-increase after insertion of titanium implants indicated CT artefacts, while the relatively low HU-increase of CF implants was not associated with artefacts. Less CT artefacts could facilitate an easier contouring phase in radiotherapy planning. In addition, we propose a CT artefact grading system based on postoperative HU-increase. This system could serve as a valuable tool in future research to assess if less CT artefacts lead to time savings during radiotherapy treatment planning and, potentially, to better tumoricidal effects and less adverse effects if particle therapy would be administered.",
Mortality reduction and cumulative excess incidence (CEI) in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening era,"Patrick W. McLaughlin, Matthew M. Cousins, Alex Tsodikov, Payal D. Soni, Juanita M. Crook",2024-03-09,"The extent to which PSA screening is related to prostate cancer mortality reduction in the United States (US) is controversial. US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data from 1980 to 2016 were examined to assess the relationship between prostate cancer mortality and cumulative excess incidence (CEI) in the PSA screening era and to clarify the impact of race on this relationship. CEI was considered as a surrogate for the intensity of prostate cancer screening with PSA testing and subsequent biopsy as appropriate. Data from 163,982,733 person-years diagnosed with 544,058 prostate cancers (9 registries, 9% of US population) were examined. Strong inverse linear relationships were noted between CEI and prostate cancer mortality, and 317,356 prostate cancer deaths were avoided. Eight regions of the US demonstrated prostate cancer mortality reduction of 46.0–63.7%. On a per population basis, the lives of more black men than white men were saved in three of four registries with sufficient black populations for comparison. Factor(s) independent of CEI (potential effects of treatment advances) explained 14.6% of the mortality benefit (p-value = 0.3357) while there was a significant main effect of CEI (effect = −0.0064; CI: [−0.0088, −0.0040]; p-value < 0.0001). Therefore, there is a strong relationship between CEI and prostate cancer mortality reduction that was not related to factors independent of screening utilization. Minority populations have experienced large mortality reductions in the context of PSA mass utilization.",
Cancer organoids 2.0: modelling the complexity of the tumour immune microenvironment,"Roel Polak, Elisa T. Zhang, Calvin J. Kuo",2024-07-08,"The development of neoplasia involves a complex and continuous interplay between malignantly transformed cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME). Cancer immunotherapies targeting the immune TME have been increasingly validated in clinical trials but response rates vary substantially between tumour histologies and are often transient, idiosyncratic and confounded by resistance. Faithful experimental models of the patient-specific tumour immune microenvironment, capable of recapitulating tumour biology and immunotherapy effects, would greatly improve patient selection, target identification and definition of resistance mechanisms for immuno-oncology therapeutics. In this Review, we discuss currently available and rapidly evolving 3D tumour organoid models that capture important immune features of the TME. We highlight diverse opportunities for organoid-based investigations of tumour immunity, drug development and precision medicine.",
Targeting IGF-IR improves neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy in breast cancers with low IGFBP7 expression,"Christopher Godina, Michael N. Pollak, Helena Jernström",2024-10-03,"There has been a long-standing interest in targeting the type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R) signaling system in breast cancer due to its key role in neoplastic proliferation and survival. However, no IGF-1R targeting agent has shown substantial clinical benefit in controlled phase 3 trials, and no biomarker has been shown to have clinical utility in the prediction of benefit from an IGF-1R targeting agent. IGFBP7 is an atypical insulin-like growth factor binding protein as it has a higher affinity for the IGF-1R than IGF ligands. We report that low IGFBP7 gene expression identifies a subset of breast cancers for which the addition of ganitumab, an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody, to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, substantially improved the pathological complete response rate compared to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone. The pCR rate in the chemotherapy plus ganitumab arm was 46.9% in patients in the lowest quartile of IGFBP7 expression, in contrast to only 5.6% in the highest quartile. Furthermore, high IGFBP7 expression predicted increased distant metastasis risk. If our findings are confirmed, decisions to halt the development of IGF-1R targeting drugs, which were based on disappointing results of prior trials that did not use predictive biomarkers, should be reviewed.",

We retrospectively analyzed data from breast cancer patients treated at a major single-center breast hospital in China. From 2020 to 2022, we identified risk factors for BCRL through logistic regression and developed and validated a nomogram using R software (version 4.1.2). Model validation was achieved through the application of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), a calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA), with further evaluated by internal validation. Among 1485 patients analyzed, 360 developed lymphedema (24.2%). The nomogram incorporated body mass index, operative time, lymph node count, axillary dissection level, surgical site infection, and radiotherapy as predictors. The AUCs for training (N = 1038) and validation (N = 447) cohorts were 0.779 and 0.724, respectively, indicating good discriminative ability. Calibration and decision curve analysis confirmed the model’s clinical utility. Our nomogram provides an accurate tool for predicting BCRL risk, with potential to enhance personalized management in breast cancer survivors. Further prospective validation across multiple centers is warranted.","Breast cancer-related lymphedema, Risk factors, Nomogram, Predictive model"
An EGFR/HER2-targeted conjugate sensitizes gemcitabine-sensitive and resistant pancreatic cancer through different SMAD4-mediated mechanisms,"Hongjuan Yao, Wenping Song, Rui Cao, Cheng Ye, Li Zhang, Hebing Chen, Junting Wang, Yuchen Shi, Rui Li, Yi Li, Xiujun Liu, Xiaofei Zhou, Rongguang Shao, Liang Li",2022-09-20,"Chemoresistance limits its clinical implementation for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We previously generated an EGFR/HER2 targeted conjugate, dual-targeting ligand-based lidamycin (DTLL), which shows a highly potent antitumor effect. To overcome chemoresistance in PDAC, we aim to study DTLL efficacy when combined with gemcitabine and explore its mechanisms of action. DTLL in combination with gemcitabine show a superior inhibitory effect on the growth of gemcitabine-resistant/sensitive tumors. DTLL sensitizes gemcitabine efficacy via distinct action mechanisms mediated by mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 4 (SMAD4). It not only prevents neoplastic proliferation via ATK/mTOR blockade and NF-κB impaired function in SMAD4-sufficient PDACs, but also restores SMAD4 bioactivity to trigger downstream NF-κB-regulated signaling in SMAD4-deficient tumors and to overcome chemoresistance. DTLL seems to act as a SMAD4 module that normalizes its function in PDAC, having a synergistic effect in combination with gemcitabine. Our findings provide insight into a rational SMAD4-directed precision therapy in PDAC.",
A retrospective study of adjuvant albumin-bound paclitaxel plus S-1 after D2 gastrectomy versus oxaliplatin plus S-1 in gastric cancer,"Ning Li, Hui Wu, Xin Xu, Qinming Wei, Yongfeng Ding, Shan Liu, Jinqiong Wu, Yulong Zheng, Nong Xu, Yuan Gao, Haiping Jiang",2024-07-02,"Adjuvant oxaliplatin plus S-1 (SOX) chemotherapy for gastric cancer (GC) after D2 gastrectomy has been proven effective. There has yet to be a study that evaluates adjuvant nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) plus S-1. In this single-center, retrospective study, GC patients after D2 gastrectomy received either nab-paclitaxel plus S-1 (AS group) or SOX group were recruited between January 2018 and December 2020 in The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. Intravenous nab-paclitaxel 120 mg/m2 or 260 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 were administered as eight 3 week cycle, especially in the AS and SOX group. Patients received S-1 twice daily with a dose of 40 mg/m2 in the two groups on days 1–14 of each cycle. The end points were disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 3 years and adverse events (AEs). There were 56 eligible patients, 28 in the AS group and 35 in the SOX group. The 3 year DFS rate was 78.0% in AS group versus 70.7% in SOX group (p = 0.46). Subgroup analysis showed that the patients with signet-ring positive in the AS group had a prolonged DFS compared with the SOX group (40.0 vs. 13.8 m, p = 0.02). The diffuse-type GC or low differentiation in the AS group was associated with numerically prolonged DFS compared with the SOX group, but the association was not statistically significant (p = 0.27 and p = 0.15 especially). Leukopenia (14.3%) were the most prevalent AEs in the AS group, while thrombocytopenia (28.5%) in the SOX group. Neutropenia (7.1% in AS group) and thrombocytopenia (22.8% in SOX group) were the most common grade 3 or 4 AEs. In this study analyzing past data, a tendency towards a greater 3 year DFS was observed when using AS regimen in signet-ring positive patients. AS group had fewer thrombocytopenia compared to SOX group. More studies should be conducted with larger sample sizes.","Gastric cancer, Adjuvant chemotherapy, Albumin-bound paclitaxel, S-1, Disease free survival"

We demonstrate that a simple protocol enriches prostatic proteins in urine. Secreted and EV proteins arise from different subcellular compartments. Urinary EVs are faithful surrogates of tissue proteomes, but secreted proteins in urine or cell line EVs are not. The urinary proteome is longitudinally stable over several years. It can accurately and non-invasively distinguish malignant from benign prostatic lesions and can risk-stratify prostate tumors. This resource quantifies the complexity of the urinary proteome and reveals the synergistic value of secreted and EV proteomes for translational and biomarker studies.",
Safety of local thermal ablation in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with cirrhosis and severe thrombocytopenia,"Feiyu Zhao, Tianlan Zhang, Qinna Yang, Xiaoming Zhang, Fan Yang, Niansong Qian",2024-11-16,"Generally, invasive treatment is contraindication for patients with severe thrombocytopenia, because it may increase risk of bleeding. However, many early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with cirrhosis have platelet counts (PC) less than 50 × 109/L due to hypersplenism. These patients are often accompanied by hepatic insufficiency, which makes hepatectomy impossible, and local thermal ablation (LTA) has become a major treatment. The aim of our study is to investigate the correlation between severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding after LTA in HCC patients with cirrhosis, and evaluate risk factors of bleeding. 473 patients with cirrhosis who underwent LTA for HCC from 2016 to 2020 were enrolled, and 709 ablations were performed in total. Based on preoperative PC, cases were divided into three groups, namely, group A (PC > 50 × 109/L), group B (30 × 109/L < PC ≤ 50 × 109/L) and group C (PC ≤ 30 × 109/L). The incidence of bleeding after LTA was compared among the three groups. Logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors for bleeding after ablation. The overall incidence of bleeding complications was 4.4%, and no significant difference was observed between group A, B, and C (3.9% vs. 6.4% vs. 3.3%, P = 0.410). In multivariate analysis, tumor diameter (OR = 2.657 per 1 cm, P < 0.001), and multiple lesions (≥ 3) (OR = 3.723, P = 0.006) were found to be independent predictors of bleeding after LTA. In small HCC patients with cirrhosis and hypersplenism, the PC range 30–50 × 109/L will not increase the risk of bleeding after LTA. Tumor diameter and number of lesions are independent predictors for bleeding after LTA in HCC patients.","Thrombocytopenia, Hepatocellular carcinoma, Postoperative hemorrhage, Microwave ablation, Radiofrequency ablation"
Sex differences in adverse events among cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors: the MOUSEION-07 systematic review and meta-analysis,"Elsa Vitale, Alessandro Rizzo, Lorenza Maistrello, Deniz Can Guven, Raffaella Massafra, Veronica Mollica, Fernando Sabino Marques Monteiro, Matteo Santoni, Francesco Massari",2024-11-16,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer treatment, but they are associated with a range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and emerging evidence suggests significant sex differences in the incidence, type, and severity of these toxicities, suggesting an influential factor and understanding sex-related differences in irAEs as crucial for optimizing patient care and improving clinical outcomes. In MOUSEION-07 study, we aimed to assess the association between sex and treatment-related adverse events in cancer patients treated with immunotherapy through a large up-to-date meta-analysis of available clinical trials. The present systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO no. CRD42024549518. Sixteen studies encompassing a total of 4658 patients were included, and 2133 adverse effects were highlighted. The analysis observed a not statistically significant difference in terms of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) between males and females (Odds Ratio 1.19; CI 0.88–1.63) and revealed the presence of publication bias (β = −2.53; 95% CI = [−4.03; −1.04]; P = 0.006). Sex differences in immunotherapy-related adverse events are a significant factor in cancer treatment, necessitating a personalized approach to patient care.

Single cell profiling of primary and paired metastatic lymph node tumors in breast cancer patients,"Tong Liu, Cheng Liu, Meisi Yan, Lei Zhang, Jing Zhang, Min Xiao, Zhigao Li, Xiaofan Wei, Hongquan Zhang",2022-11-10,"The microenvironment of lymph node metastasized tumors (LNMT) determines tumor progression and response to therapy, but a systematic study of LNMT is lacking. Here, we generate single-cell maps of primary tumors (PTs) and paired LNMTs in 8 breast cancer patients. We demonstrate that the activation, cytotoxicity, and proliferation of T cells are suppressed in LNMT compared with PT. CD4+CXCL13+ T cells in LNMT are more likely to differentiate into an exhausted state. Interestingly, LAMP3+ dendritic cells in LNMT display lower T cell priming and activating ability than in PT. Additionally, we identify a subtype of PLA2G2A+ cancer-associated fibroblasts enriched in HER2+ breast cancer patients that promotes immune infiltration. We also show that the antigen-presentation pathway is downregulated in malignant cells of the metastatic lymph node. Altogether, we characterize the microenvironment of LNMT and PT, which may shed light on the individualized therapeutic strategies for breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis.",
Longitudinal lung cancer prediction convolutional neural network model improves the classification of indeterminate pulmonary nodules,"Rafael Paez, Michael N. Kammer, Aneri Balar, Dhairya A.

Grogan, Fabien Maldonado",2023-04-15,"A deep learning model (LCP CNN) for the stratification of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) demonstrated better discrimination than commonly used clinical prediction models. However, the LCP CNN score is based on a single timepoint that ignores longitudinal information when prior imaging studies are available. Clinically, IPNs are often followed over time and temporal trends in nodule size or morphology inform management. In this study we investigated whether the change in LCP CNN scores over time was different between benign and malignant nodules. This study used a prospective-specimen collection, retrospective-blinded-evaluation (PRoBE) design. Subjects with incidentally or screening detected IPNs 6–30 mm in diameter with at least 3 consecutive CT scans prior to diagnosis (slice thickness ≤ 1.5 mm) with the same nodule present were included. Disease outcome was adjudicated by biopsy-proven malignancy, biopsy-proven benign disease and absence of growth on at least 2-year imaging follow-up. Lung nodules were analyzed using the Optellum LCP CNN model. Investigators performing image analysis were blinded to all clinical data. The LCP CNN score was determined for 48 benign and 32 malignant nodules. There was no significant difference in the initial LCP CNN score between benign and malignant nodules. Overall, the LCP CNN scores of benign nodules remained relatively stable over time while that of malignant nodules continued to increase over time. The difference in these two trends was statistically significant. We also developed a joint model that incorporates longitudinal LCP CNN scores to predict future probability of cancer. Malignant and benign nodules appear to have distinctive trends in LCP CNN score over time. This suggests that longitudinal modeling may improve radiomic prediction of lung cancer over current models. Additional studies are needed to validate these early findings.",

However, dexamethasone can cause several side effects even after short-term administration. Therefore, the development of dexamethasone-free antiemetic therapies has been recognized as an important challenge. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of palonosetron, aprepitant, and olanzapine. Patients who were chemotherapy-naïve and scheduled to receive highly emetogenic chemotherapy for breast cancer were enrolled and assessed for nausea and vomiting occurring within 120 h after the start of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the total control (TC) rate of overall phases. Secondary endpoints included the complete response (CR) rate, which was evaluated during the acute, delayed, and overall phases. A total of 88 patients were enrolled from eight centers in Japan, of whom 84 were included in the analysis. The proportion of patients achieving TC throughout the overall period was 17.1%. Similarly, CR and CC rates for the overall period were 43.4% and 39.5%, respectively. Frequently reported adverse events were loss of appetite and constipation, with rates of 52.4% and 50.0%, respectively. The primary endpoint was not achieved. Therefore, antiemetic therapy without dexamethasone shows an inadequate effect on nausea, and it is generally advisable to avoid omitting dexamethasone. However, in the overall period, both CR and CC were comparable to conventional three-drug combination therapy. Thus, in patients unable to use dexamethasone, replacing it with olanzapine could be an option.Trial registration number: UMIN 000038644, November 20, 2019.

Loss of EMI1 compromises chromosome stability and is associated with cellular transformation in colonic epithelial cell contexts,"Rubi Campos Gudiño, Nicole M. Neudorf, Demi Andromidas, Zelda Lichtensztejn, Kirk J. McManus",2024-10-02,"BackgroundColorectal cancer (CRC) is still a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Thus, identifying the aberrant genes and proteins underlying disease pathogenesis is critical to improve early detection methods and develop novel therapeutic strategies. Chromosome instability (CIN), or ongoing changes in chromosome complements, is a predominant form of genome instability. It is a driver of genetic heterogeneity found in ~85% of CRCs. Although CIN contributes to CRC pathogenesis, the molecular determinants underlying CIN remain poorly understood. Recently, EMI1, an F-box protein, was identified as a candidate CIN gene. In this study, we sought to determine the impact reduced EMI1 expression has on CIN and cellular transformation.MethodsCoupling siRNA-based silencing and CRISPR/Cas9 knockout clones with quantitative imaging microscopy we evaluated the impact reduced EMI1 expression has on CIN and cellular transformation in four colonic epithelial cell contexts.ResultsQuantitative imaging microscopy data revealed that reduced EMI1 expression induces increases in CIN phenotypes in both transient (siRNA) and constitutive (CRISPR/Cas9) cell models that are associated with increases in DNA damage and cellular transformation phenotypes in long-term studies.ConclusionsThis study determined that reduced EMI1 expression induces CIN and promotes cellular transformation, which is consistent with a role in early CRC development.",

Elevated VIP levels are also present in PDAC patient plasma and supernatants of cultured PDAC cells. Furthermore, T cells up-regulate VIP receptors after activation, identifying the VIP signaling pathway as a potential target to enhance T cell function. In mouse PDAC models, VIP-R antagonist peptides synergize with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment in improving T cell recruitment into the tumors, activation of tumor-antigen-specific T cells, and inhibition of T cell exhaustion. In contrast to the limited single-agent activity of anti-PD1 antibodies or VIP-R antagonist peptides, combining both therapies eliminate tumors in up to 40% of animals. Furthermore, tumor-free mice resist tumor re-challenge, indicating anti-cancer immunological memory generation. VIP-R signaling thus represents a tumor-protective immune-modulatory pathway that is targetable in PDAC.",

Clamp, Richard J. Edmondson, Benoit You, D. Gareth R. Evans, Gordon C. Jayson, Stephen S. Taylor",2024-11-16,"BackgroundHigh-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) can be treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and delayed primary surgery (DPS). Histopathological response to NACT can be assessed using Böhm’s chemotherapy response score (CRS). We investigated whether germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA1/2) genotype associated with omental CRS phenotype.MethodsA retrospective study of patients with newly diagnosed FIGO stage IIIC/IV HGSOC prescribed NACT and tested for gBRCA1/2 pathogenic variants (PVs) between September 2017 and December 2022 at The Christie Hospital. The Cox proportional hazards model evaluated the association between survival and key clinical factors. The chi-square test assessed the association between CRS3 (no/minimal residual tumour) and gBRCA1/2 status.ResultsOf 586 eligible patients, 393 underwent DPS and had a CRS reported. Independent prognostic factors by multivariable analysis were gBRCA1/2 status (PV versus wild type [WT]), CRS (3 versus 1 + 2), surgical outcome (complete versus optimal/suboptimal) and first-line poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1/2 inhibitor maintenance therapy (yes versus no) (all P < 0.05). There was a non-significant trend for tumours with a gBRCA2 PV having CRS3 versus WT (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.95–4.91; P = 0.0647). By contrast, tumours with a gBRCA1 PV were significantly less likely to have CRS3 than WT (OR = 0.35, 95%CI 0.14–0.91; P = 0.0291).ConclusionsGermline BRCA1/2 genotype was not clearly associated with superior omental CRS. Further research is required to understand how HGSOC biology defines CRS.",
"Investigating the safety of photobiomodulation in oral carcinogenesis: insights into cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis via the 4NQO model","Lauren Frenzel Schuch, Daniela Campagnol, Tuany Rafaeli Schmidt, Carolina Horn Troian Michel, Tuane Nerissa Alves Garcez, Vanessa Rodrigues Velho, Vivian Petersen Wagner, Rogerio Moraes Castilho, Felipe Martins Silveira, Ronell Bologna-Molina, Marco Antonio Trevizani Martins, Chris Krebs Danilevicz, Alan Roger Santos-Silva, Pablo Agustin Vargas, Manoela Domingues Martins",2024-11-16,"The present investigation aimed to assess the safety of photobiomodulation (PBM) on the oral carcinogenesis process induced by 4NQO, focusing on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Sixty-six Wistar rats received systemic 4NQO for 12 (n = 33) and 20 weeks (n = 33), divided into Control group, PBM 0.3 J, and PBM 1 J. Applications for PBM occurred three times a week. At weeks 12 and 20, the animals were euthanized. The immunoreactivity for anti-ROS1 and anti-p53 antibodies was also assessed. Statistical analysis was assessed by multiple t-tests, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman’s correlation. At 12 weeks, PBM 1 J group had nodular lesions, distinct from control and PBM 0.3 J groups (p = 0.005). At 20 weeks, nodular lesions were common in control and PBM 0.3 J groups. Histopathological characteristics did not significantly differ between groups at 12 (p = 0.30) and 20 weeks (p = 0.58). Epithelial dysplasia (n = 21) was common at 12 weeks. After 20 weeks, most of the cases revealed squamous cell carcinoma (n = 24). No differences were observed in the immunostaining of p53 and ROS1 among the control and experimental groups and there was no correlation of these proteins with clinicopathological data. During the carcinogenesis process, the PBM did not modify the development of oral lesions and the expression of proliferative and apoptosis proteins.","Oral cancer, Oral potentially malignant disorder, Carcinogenesis, Leukoplakia, Photobiomodulation therapy, Laser therapy"
Unveiling the comorbidity burden of male breast cancer,"Alejandro Santos-Mejías, Aida Moreno-Juste, Clara Laguna-Berna, Beatriz Poblador-Plou, Daniel Aparicio-Lopéz, María Carmen Casamayor Franco, Reyes Ibañez Carreras, Antonio Gimeno-Miguel",2024-10-03,"Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare condition with unique characteristics compared to female breast cancer (FBC). Despite its scarceness, there is growing evidence that MBC should not be studied and treated as FBC due to factors like later diagnosis stage and distinct genetic makeup. Retrospective observational study in the EpiChron Cohort, selecting all the prevalent patients with breast cancer between 2010 and 2019. Logistic models were used to determine associated comorbidities. Between 2010 and 2019, 105 MBC and 11,657 FBC patients were found in the EpiChron Cohort. MBC patients had a high mean age at diagnosis and number of comorbidities. Paying attention to comorbidity prevalences in breast cancer patients, it was clear that MBC patients tended to be prone to cardio-metabolic coexisting diseases, while FBC patients were more prone to hormone-, bone- and mental diseases. There were nine chronic conditions associated to MBC patients, but after a year-by-birth matching only four associations remained. Two of them were associated previously [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)]: “Disorder of lipid metabolism” [1.65 (1.03–2.64)] and “Genitourinary symptoms and ill-defined conditions” [2.03 (1.07–3.87)]; and the other two were new, “Anxiety disorders” [2.05 (1.09–3.87)] and “Osteoporosis” [3.58 (1.26–10.14)]. After comparing associated comorbidities in FBC with those in MBC, it seems MBC patients share some of them, but they have their own particular set of coexisting diseases. In fact, once a year-by-birth matching was performed in MBC patient cohort, it was more obvious MBC comorbidities behave more similar to none-Breast-Cancer male population than to FBC patients. These findings highlight the distinct characteristics of the MBC patient population and the need for a tailored approach of managing MBC.","Male breast cancer, Comorbidity, Breast cancer, Co-existing conditions, Clinical characteristics, Clinical feature"
Blocking ActRIIB and restoring appetite reverses cachexia and improves survival in mice with lung cancer,"Andre Lima Queiroz, Ezequiel Dantas, Shakti Ramsamooj, Anirudh Murthy, Mujmmail Ahmed, Elizabeth R. M. Zunica, Roger J. Liang, Jessica Murphy, Corey D. Holman, Curtis J. Bare, Gregory Ghahramani, Zhidan Wu, David E. Cohen, John P. Kirwan, Lewis C. Cantley, Christopher L. Axelrod, Marcus D. Goncalves",2022-08-08,"Cancer cachexia is a common, debilitating condition with limited therapeutic options. Using an established mouse model of lung cancer, we find that cachexia is characterized by reduced food intake, spontaneous activity, and energy expenditure accompanied by muscle metabolic dysfunction and atrophy. We identify Activin A as a purported driver of cachexia and treat with ActRIIB-Fc, a decoy ligand for TGF-β/activin family members, together with anamorelin (Ana), a ghrelin receptor agonist, to reverse muscle dysfunction and anorexia, respectively. Ana effectively increases food intake but only the combination of drugs increases lean mass, restores spontaneous activity, and improves overall survival. These beneficial effects are limited to female mice and are dependent on ovarian function. In agreement, high expression of Activin A in human lung adenocarcinoma correlates with unfavorable prognosis only in female patients, despite similar expression levels in both sexes. This study suggests that multimodal, sex-specific, therapies are needed to reverse cachexia.",
FOXA2 rewires AP-1 for transcriptional reprogramming and lineage plasticity in prostate cancer,"Zifeng Wang, Scott L.

Taylor, Mitchell G. Lawrence, Housheng Hansen He, Luke A. Selth, Changmeng Cai",2024-06-08,"FOXA family proteins act as pioneer factors by remodeling compact chromatin structures. FOXA1 is crucial for the chromatin binding of the androgen receptor (AR) in both normal prostate epithelial cells and the luminal subtype of prostate cancer (PCa). Recent studies have highlighted the emergence of FOXA2 as an adaptive response to AR signaling inhibition treatments. However, the role of the FOXA1 to FOXA2 transition in regulating cancer lineage plasticity remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that FOXA2 binds to distinct classes of developmental enhancers in multiple AR-independent PCa subtypes, with its binding depending on LSD1. Moreover, we reveal that FOXA2 collaborates with JUN at chromatin and promotes transcriptional reprogramming of AP-1 in lineage-plastic cancer cells, thereby facilitating cell state transitions to multiple lineages. Overall, our findings underscore the pivotal role of FOXA2 as a pan-plasticity driver that rewires AP-1 to induce the differential transcriptional reprogramming necessary for cancer cell lineage plasticity.",
Clinical features and treatment outcomes of intraocular and ocular adnexal metastasis,"Wantanee Dangboon Tsutsumi, Apinya Rattanasuwan, Orapan Aryasit",2024-07-03,"The aim of this study was to investigate the primary sites, clinical characteristics, and treatment outcomes of patients with metastatic tumors in the eye and ocular adnexa. This retrospective case series consisted of 42 patients diagnosed with intraocular metastasis (IM) or ocular adnexal metastasis (OAM) at a tertiary center between January 2001 and June 2023. The patients comprised 18 men and 24 women; 24 (57%) and 18 (43%) patients were diagnosed with IM and OAM, respectively. In the IM group, the primary tumors originated from the lungs (79%), followed by the breasts (17%). In the OAM group, the primary tumors originated from the breasts (33%). Previously, 57% of the patients had been diagnosed with cancer. In the IM group, 38% exhibited bilateral involvement. Only 6% of the patients with OAM had bilateral diseases. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 42%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median OS since metastasis diagnosis in the lungs and breast was 11.8 and 10.5 months, respectively. Lung cancer remains the predominant primary cancer in IM, whereas breast cancer is the major cancer in OAM. Despite poor OS, early detection will facilitate the prompt treatment of primary cancer and metastatic sites.","Lung cancer, Breast cancer, Intraocular metastasis, Ocular adnexal metastasis, Ocular adnexa, Overall survival"
Deep learning for oncologic treatment outcomes and endpoints evaluation from CT scans in liver cancer,"Yujia Xia, Jie Zhou, Xiaolei Xun, Luke Johnston, Ting Wei, Ruitian Gao, Yufei Zhang, Bobby Reddy, Chao Liu, Geoffrey Kim, Jin Zhang, Shuai Zhao, Zhangsheng Yu",2024-11-17,"Accurate treatment response assessment using serial CT scans is essential in oncological clinical trials. However, oncologists’ assessment following the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline is subjective, time-consuming, and sometimes fallible. Advanced liver cancer often presents multifocal hepatic lesions on CT imaging, making accurate characterization more challenging than with other malignancies. In this work, we developed a tumor volume guided comprehensive objective response evaluation based on deep learning (RECORD) for liver cancer. RECORD performs liver tumor segmentation, followed by sum of the volume (SOV)-based treatment response classification and new lesion assessment. Then, it can provide treatment evaluations of response, stability, and progression, and calculates progression-free survival (PFS) and response time. The RECORD pipeline was developed with both CNN and ViT backbones. Its performance was evaluated in three longitudinal cohorts involving 60 multi-national centers, 206 patients, 891 CT scans, using internal five-fold cross-validation and external validations. RECORD with the most effective backbone achieved an average AUC-response of 0.981, AUC-stable of 0.929, and AUC-progression of 0.969 for SOV-based disease status classification, F1-score of 0.887 for new lesion identification, and accuracy of 0.889 for final treatment outcome assessments across all cohorts. RECORD’s PFS and response time predictions strongly correlated with clinician’s assessments (P < 0.001). Moreover, RECORD can better stratify high-risk versus low-risk patients for overall survival compared to the human-assessed RECIST results. In conclusion, RECORD demonstrates efficiency and objectivity in analyzing liver lesions for treatment response evaluation. Further research should extend the pipeline to other metastatic organ sites.",
ZIP1+ fibroblasts protect lung cancer against chemotherapy via connexin-43 mediated intercellular Zn2+ transfer,"Chen Ni, Xiaohan Lou, Xiaohan Yao, Linlin Wang, Jiajia Wan, Xixi Duan, Jialu Liang, Kaili Zhang, Yuanyuan Yang, Li Zhang, Chanjun Sun, Zhenzhen Li, Ming Wang, Linyu Zhu, Dekang Lv, Zhihai Qin",2022-10-07,"Tumour–stroma cell interactions impact cancer progression and therapy responses. Intercellular communication between fibroblasts and cancer cells using various soluble mediators has often been reported. In this study, we find that a zinc-transporter (ZIP1) positive tumour-associated fibroblast subset is enriched after chemotherapy and directly interconnects lung cancer cells with gap junctions. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify several fibroblast subpopulations, among which Zip1+ fibroblasts are highly enriched in mouse lung tumours after doxorubicin treatment. ZIP1 expression on fibroblasts enhances gap junction formation in cancer cells by upregulating connexin-43. Acting as a Zn2+ reservoir, ZIP1+ fibroblasts absorb and transfer Zn2+ to cancer cells, leading to ABCB1-mediated chemoresistance. Clinically, ZIP1high stromal fibroblasts are also associated with chemoresistance in human lung cancers. Taken together, our results reveal a mechanism by which fibroblasts interact directly with tumour cells via gap junctions and contribute to chemoresistance in lung cancer.",
Mechanistic patterns and clinical implications of oncogenic tyrosine kinase fusions in human cancers,"Taek-Chin Cheong, Ahram Jang, Qi Wang, Giulia C. Leonardi, Biagio Ricciuti, Joao V. Alessi, Alessandro Di Federico, Mark M. Awad, Maria K. Lehtinen, Marian H. Harris, Roberto Chiarle",2024-06-14,"Tyrosine kinase (TK) fusions are frequently found in cancers, either as initiating events or as a mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy. Partner genes and exons in most TK fusions are followed typical recurrent patterns, but the underlying mechanisms and clinical implications of these patterns are poorly understood. By developing Functionally Active Chromosomal Translocation Sequencing (FACTS), we discover that typical TK fusions involving ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 are selected from pools of chromosomal rearrangements by two major determinants: active transcription of the fusion partner genes and protein stability. In contrast, atypical TK fusions that are rarely seen in patients showed reduced protein stability, decreased downstream oncogenic signaling, and were less responsive to inhibition. Consistently, patients with atypical TK fusions were associated with a reduced response to TKI therapies. Our findings highlight the principles of oncogenic TK fusion formation and selection in cancers, with clinical implications for guiding targeted therapy.",

The primary endpoints were recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for phase Ib and objective response rate (ORR) for phase II. The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response, time to response and safety. Without dose-limiting or unexpected toxicities, the starting dose in the phase Ib trial was selected as RP2D.

We previously analyzed the RHOH gene structure and demonstrated that this gene is composed of 7 exons, one single encoding exon located at the 3ʹ extremity of the gene, preceded by 6 noncoding exons. To further understand the transcription events associated with this gene, we performed full-length RNA-Seq on 12 B-cell lines. We identified new exons, new splice events and new splice sites, leading to the discovery of 38 RHOH mRNA molecules, 27 of which have never been described before.

Implications of unconventional histological subtypes on magnetic resonance imaging and oncological outcomes in patients who have undergone radical prostatectomy,"Koichiro Kurokawa, Yasutaka Yamada, Shinichi Sakamoto, Takuro Horikoshi, Kodai Sato, Sakie Nanba, Yoshihiro Kubota, Manato Kanesaka, Ayumi Fujimoto, Nobuyoshi Takeuchi, Hiroki Shibata, Tomokazu Sazuka, Yusuke Imamura, Toyonori Tsuzuki, Takashi Uno, Tomohiko Ichikawa",2024-06-27,"The prognostic significance of unconventional histology (UH) subtypes including intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P), ductal adenocarcinoma, and cribriform pattern has been investigated for prostate cancer (PCa). However, little is known about magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and the oncological impact of tumor localization in localized PCa with UH. Clinical data of 211 patients with acinar adenocarcinoma (conventional histology [CH]) and 82 patients with UH who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) were reviewed. Patients with UH are more likely to be older and have higher Gleason grade group, higher Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.1 score, and larger tumor volume (TV) than those with CH. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of UH as an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ration (HR) 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22–0.79, P = 0.0073). No significant difference in PFS was seen regarding tumor localization (transition zone [TZ] or peripheral zone [PZ]) in patients with UH (P = 0.8949), whereas PZ cancer showed shorter PFS in patients with CH (P = 0.0174). PCa with UH was associated with higher progression than PCa with CH among resection margin (RM)-negative cases (P < 0.0001). Further, increased PI-RADS v2.1 score did not correlate with larger TV in UH (P = 0.991), whereas a significant difference in TV was observed in CH (P < 0.0001). The prognostic significance of UH tumor was independent of tumor localization, and shorter PFS was observed even in RM-negative cases, indicating an aggressive subtype with micro-metastatic potential. Furthermore, UH tumors are more likely to harbor a large TV despite PI-RADS v2.1 score ≤ 3. These findings will help optimal perioperative management for PCa with UH.","PI-RADS v2.1, Cribriform, Intra-ductal carcinoma of the prostate, Ductal carcinoma, Radical prostatectomy"
Multiomics biomarkers were not superior to clinical variables for pan-cancer screening,"Martin Smelik, Yelin Zhao, Dina Mansour Aly, AKM Firoj Mahmud, Oleg Sysoev, Xinxiu Li, Mikael Benson",2024-11-17,"BackgroundCancer screening tests are considered pivotal for early diagnosis and survival. However, the efficacy of these tests for improving survival has recently been questioned. This study aims to test if cancer screening could be improved by biomarkers in peripheral blood based on multi-omics data.MethodsWe utilize multi-omics data from 500,000 participants in the UK Biobank. Machine learning is applied to search for proteins, metabolites, genetic variants, or clinical variables to diagnose cancers collectively and individually.ResultsHere we show that the overall performance of the potential blood biomarkers do not outperform clinical variables for collective diagnosis. However, we observe promising results for individual cancers in close proximity to peripheral blood, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) greater than 0.8.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the identification of blood biomarkers for cancer might be complicated by variable overlap between molecular changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood. This explanation is supported by local proteomics analyses of different tumors, which all show high AUCs, greater than 0.9. Thus, multi-omics biomarkers for the diagnosis of individual cancers may potentially be effective, but not for groups of cancers.",
Pan-cancer analysis of oncogenic role of CEP55 and experiment validation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma,"Libin zhou, Yimeng Zhu, Fei Guo, Huimin Long, Min Yin",2024-11-16,"Immunotherapy has emerged as a vital component in the contemporary landscape of cancer treatment. Recent studies have indicated that CEP55 plays an oncogenic role; however, its specific mechanisms in promoting tumor proliferation and its potential value in prognosis and immunotherapy prediction across various cancers remain to be elucidated. CEP55 was significantly overexpressed in 22 cancer types compared with their adjacent normal tissues. Elevated CEP55 expression was positively correlated with younger onset age, worse tumor stage, lower response rate to the first treatment, lower tumor-free survival rate, and poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) prognosis in most cancers. Moreover, CEP55 expression was positively correlated with its binding and related genes, such as KIF11 (R = 0.83, P < 0.001), CDK1 (R = 0.77, P < 0.001) and CCNA2 (R = 0.76, P < 0.001), and the classic proliferation markers, including MKI67 and PCNA. Enrichment analyses indicated that CEP55 was predominantly associated with cell division, cell cycle activities and proliferation. Immune cell infiltration analysis by TIMER2.0 revealed that CEP55 expression was positively correlated with many kinds of infiltrating cells, such as Th2 cells and some CD4+ T cell subsets. The CEP55 expression was positively associated with increased MSI and TMB in various cancers. Our analyzation indicated that the CEP55 expression level in patients with complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) to anti-PDL1 therapy was significantly higher than patients with stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) based on IMvigor210 cohort. We also used Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA) to predict a serious of small molecule CEP55 targeted drugs, such as AZ628, SB52334, SB590885, A-770,041, AZD7762, Elesclomol, panobinostat, BRD-A94377914, and LRRK2-IN-1. Furthermore, the patients with high level of CEP55-posivie tumor epithelial cells had inferior overall survival in ccRCC according to single-cell analysis. Finally, our wet lab experiments verified that the CEP55-positive rate in ccRCC tissues (19/30, 63.3%) was significantly higher than that in renal adjacent tissues (10/30, 33.3%). The clinicopathologic analysis revealed that CEP55 protein level was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.044), histology grade (P < 0.001) and stage (P = 0.034). Our study indicated that CEP55 overexpression in most caner types was associated with poor prognosis. Notably, CEP55 was closely relevant to immune cell infiltration and impacted the response to immunotherapy and small molecule drugs against cancers.","CEP55, ccRCC, Pan-cancer analysis, Immune infiltration, Immunotherapy response, Proliferation markers"
Spatial analysis of the glioblastoma proteome reveals specific molecular signatures and markers of survival,"Marie Duhamel, Lauranne Drelich, Maxence Wisztorski, Soulaimane Aboulouard, Jean-Pascal Gimeno, Nina Ogrinc, Patrick Devos, Tristan Cardon, Michael Weller, Fabienne Escande, Fahed Zairi, Claude-Alain Maurage, Émilie Le Rhun, Isabelle Fournier, Michel Salzet",2022-11-04,"Molecular heterogeneity is a key feature of glioblastoma that impedes patient stratification and leads to large discrepancies in mean patient survival.

Integration of protein expression and clinical information highlights three molecular groups associated with immune, neurogenesis, and tumorigenesis signatures with high intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Furthermore, a set of proteins originating from reference and alternative ORFs is found to be statistically significant based on patient survival times. Among these proteins, a 5-protein signature is associated with survival. The expression of these 5 proteins is validated by immunofluorescence on an additional cohort of 50 patients. Overall, our work characterizes distinct molecular regions within glioblastoma tissues based on protein expression, which may help guide glioblastoma prognosis and improve current glioblastoma classification.",

Patients often experience several response-relapse events, until tumors become resistant and life expectancy drops to 12–15 months. Despite improved knowledge of the molecular determinants of platinum resistance, the lack of clinical applicability limits exploitation of many potential targets, leaving patients with limited options. Serine biosynthesis has been linked to cancer growth and poor prognosis in various cancer types, however its role in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is not known. Here, we show that a subgroup of resistant tumors decreases phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) expression at relapse after platinum-based chemotherapy. Mechanistically, we observe that this phenomenon is accompanied by a specific oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) regenerating phenotype, which helps tumor cells in sustaining Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity under platinum treatment.

Programmable melanoma-targeted radio-immunotherapy via fusogenic liposomes functionalized with multivariate-gated aptamer assemblies,"Xijiao Ren, Rui Xue, Yan Luo, Shuang Wang, Xinyue Ge, Xuemei Yao, Liqi Li, Junxia Min, Menghuan Li, Zhong Luo, Fudi Wang",2024-06-12,"Radio-immunotherapy exploits the immunostimulatory features of ionizing radiation (IR) to enhance antitumor effects and offers emerging opportunities for treating invasive tumor indications such as melanoma. However, insufficient dose deposition and immunosuppressive microenvironment (TME) of solid tumors limit its efficacy. Here we report a programmable sequential therapeutic strategy based on multifunctional fusogenic liposomes (Lip@AUR-ACP-aptPD-L1) to overcome the intrinsic radio-immunotherapeutic resistance of solid tumors. Specifically, fusogenic liposomes are loaded with gold-containing Auranofin (AUR) and inserted with multivariate-gated aptamer assemblies (ACP) and PD-L1 aptamers in the lipid membrane, potentiating melanoma-targeted AUR delivery while transferring ACP onto cell surface through selective membrane fusion. AUR amplifies IR-induced immunogenic death of melanoma cells to release antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for triggering adaptive antitumor immunity. AUR-sensitized radiotherapy also upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression that combined with released ATP to activate ACP through an “and” logic operation-like process (AND-gate), thus triggering the in-situ release of engineered cytosine-phosphate-guanine aptamer-based immunoadjuvants (eCpG) for stimulating dendritic cell-mediated T cell priming. Furthermore, AUR inhibits tumor-intrinsic vascular endothelial growth factor signaling to suppress infiltration of immunosuppressive cells for fostering an anti-tumorigenic TME. This study offers an approach for solid tumor treatment in the clinics.",
Frequency and clinical impact of viraemia in paediatric patients undergoing therapy for cancer,"Anke Barnbrock, Annemarie Berger, Melchior Lauten, Martin Demmert, Jan-Henning Klusmann, Sandra Ciesek, Konrad Bochennek, Thomas Lehrnbecher",2024-06-27,"In contrast to transplant recipients, there is a paucity of data regarding frequency and clinical significance of viraemia in children receiving conventional chemotherapy. In a prospective observational study, we assessed the frequency of and clinical impact of viraemia with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus, human herpesvirus-6 (HHV6) and herpes-simplex virus 1/2 (HSV1/2) in paediatric cancer patients at diagnosis, at a routine examination during intensive chemotherapy, and during febrile neutropenia (FN). Seventy-nine patients (median age 6 years; 66 children with haematological malignancies) were included in the study. Overall, 362 blood samples were analysed, 72 from the time at diagnosis (11.1% with positive PCR result), 118 during a regular control after chemotherapy (11.0% positive), and 159 during FN (8.8% positive). The overall positivity rate was 9.6% (CMV 3.3%, HHV6 2.7%, HSV 2.2%, EBV 0.8% and adenovirus 0.3%). There were no significant differences between FN episodes with and without viraemia in terms of duration of fever or neutropenia/lymphopenia, severity of mucositis (> II0), incidence of diarrhea and ICU admission. Our results indicate that viraemia in paediatric cancer patients generally does not have a major clinical impact, and may help in the decision regarding the indication of routine evaluation for viraemia in febrile neutropenic, but otherwise asymptomatic children.","Child, Cancer, Viraemia, Febrile neutropenia"
Mesenchymal glioma stem cells trigger vasectasia—distinct neovascularization process stimulated by extracellular vesicles carrying EGFR,"Cristiana Spinelli, Lata Adnani, Brian Meehan, Laura Montermini, Sidong Huang, Minjun Kim, Tamiko Nishimura, Sidney E. Croul, Ichiro Nakano, Yasser Riazalhosseini, Janusz Rak",2024-04-03,"Targeting neovascularization in glioblastoma (GBM) is hampered by poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms and unclear linkages to tumour molecular landscapes. Here we report that different molecular subtypes of human glioma stem cells (GSC) trigger distinct endothelial responses involving either angiogenic or circumferential vascular growth (vasectasia). The latter process is selectively triggered by mesenchymal (but not proneural) GSCs and is mediated by a subset of extracellular vesicles (EVs) able to transfer EGFR/EGFRvIII transcript to endothelial cells. Inhibition of the expression and phosphorylation of EGFR in endothelial cells, either pharmacologically (Dacomitinib) or genetically (gene editing), abolishes their EV responses in vitro and disrupts vasectasia in vivo. Therapeutic inhibition of EGFR markedly extends anticancer effects of VEGF blockade in mice, coupled with abrogation of vasectasia and prolonged survival. Thus, vasectasia driven by intercellular transfer of oncogenic EGFR may represent a new therapeutic target in a subset of GBMs.",
Comprehensive characterization of RAS mutations in colon and rectal cancers in old and young patients,"Ilya G.

Golemis, Joshua E. Meyer",2019-08-19,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is increasingly appreciated as a heterogeneous disease, with factors such as microsatellite instability (MSI), cancer subsite within the colon versus rectum, and age of diagnosis associated with specific disease course and therapeutic response. Activating oncogenic mutations in KRAS and NRAS are common in CRC, driving tumor progression and influencing efficacy of both cytotoxic and targeted therapies. The RAS mutational spectrum differs substantially between tumors arising from distinct tissues. Structure-function analysis of relatively common somatic RAS mutations in G12, Q61, and other codons is characterized by differing potency and modes of action. Here we show the mutational profile of KRAS, NRAS, and the less common HRAS in 13,336 CRC tumors, comparing the frequency of specific mutations based on age of diagnosis, MSI status, and colon versus rectum subsite. We identify mutation hotspots, and unexpected differences in mutation spectrum, based on these clinical parameters.",
Integrated molecular characterization of chondrosarcoma reveals critical determinants of disease progression,"Rémy Nicolle, Mira Ayadi, Anne Gomez-Brouchet, Lucile Armenoult, Guillaume Banneau, Nabila Elarouci, Matthias Tallegas, Anne-Valérie Decouvelaere, Sébastien Aubert, Françoise Rédini, Béatrice Marie, Corinne Labit-Bouvier, Nicolas Reina, Marie Karanian, Louis-Romée le Nail, Philippe Anract, François Gouin, Frédérique Larousserie, Aurélien de Reyniès, Gonzague de Pinieux",2019-10-11,"Chondrosarcomas are primary cancers of cartilaginous tissue with highly contrasting prognoses. These tumors are defined by recurrent mutations in the IDH genes and other genetic alterations including inactivation of CDKN2A and COL2A1; however, these have no clinical value. Here we use multi-omics molecular profiles from a series of cartilage tumors and find an mRNA classification that identifies two subtypes of chondrosarcomas defined by a balance in tumor differentiation and cell cycle activation. The microRNA classification reveals the importance of the loss of expression of the 14q32 locus in defining the level of malignancy. Finally, DNA methylation is associated with IDH mutations. We can use the multi-omics classifications to predict outcome. We propose an mRNA-only classifier to reproduce the integrated multi-omics classification, and its application to relapsed tumor samples shows the progressive nature of the classification. Thus, it may be possible to use mRNA-based signatures to detect patients with high-risk chondrosarcomas.",
AURKB as a target in non-small cell lung cancer with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy,"Jordi Bertran-Alamillo, Valérie Cattan, Marie Schoumacher, Jordi Codony-Servat, Ana Giménez-Capitán, Frédérique Cantero, Mike Burbridge, Sonia Rodríguez, Cristina Teixidó, Ruth Roman, Josep Castellví, Silvia García-Román, Carles Codony-Servat, Santiago Viteri, Andrés-Felipe Cardona, Niki Karachaliou, Rafael Rosell, Miguel-Angel Molina-Vila",2019-04-18,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors harboring mutations in EGFR ultimately relapse to therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs). Here, we show that resistant cells without the p.T790M or other acquired mutations are sensitive to the Aurora B (AURKB) inhibitors barasertib and S49076. Phospho-histone H3 (pH3), a major product of AURKB, is increased in most resistant cells and treatment with AURKB inhibitors reduces the levels of pH3, triggering G1/S arrest and polyploidy. Senescence is subsequently induced in cells with acquired mutations while, in their absence, polyploidy is followed by cell death. Finally, in NSCLC patients, pH3 levels are increased after progression on EGFR TKIs and high pH3 baseline correlates with shorter survival. Our results reveal that AURKB activation is associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs, and that AURKB constitutes a potential target in NSCLC progressing to anti-EGFR therapy and not carrying resistance mutations.",
The new-generation selective ROS1/NTRK inhibitor DS-6051b overcomes crizotinib resistant ROS1-G2032R mutation in preclinical models,"Ryohei Katayama, Bo Gong, Noriko Togashi, Masaya Miyamoto, Masaki Kiga, Shiho Iwasaki, Yasuki Kamai, Yuichi Tominaga, Yasuyuki Takeda, Yoshiko Kagoshima, Yuki Shimizu, Yosuke Seto, Tomoko Oh-hara, Sumie Koike, Naoki Nakao, Hiroyuki Hanzawa, Kengo Watanabe, Satoshi Yoda, Noriko Yanagitani, Aaron N.

Crizotinib, an ALK/ROS1/MET inhibitor, is highly effective against ROS1-rearranged lung cancer and is used in clinic. However, crizotinib resistance is an emerging issue, and several resistance mechanisms, such as secondary kinase-domain mutations (e.g., ROS1-G2032R) have been identified in crizotinib-refractory patients. Here we characterize a new selective ROS1/NTRK inhibitor, DS-6051b, in preclinical models of ROS1- or NTRK-rearranged cancers. DS-6051b induces dramatic growth inhibition of both wild type and G2032R mutant ROS1–rearranged cancers or NTRK-rearranged cancers in vitro and in vivo. Here we report that DS-6051b is effective in treating ROS1- or NTRK-rearranged cancer in preclinical models, including crizotinib-resistant ROS1 positive cancer with secondary kinase domain mutations especially G2032R mutation which is highly resistant to crizotinib as well as lorlatinib and entrectinib, next generation ROS1 inhibitors.",
LncRNA-p21 alters the antiandrogen enzalutamide-induced prostate cancer neuroendocrine differentiation via modulating the EZH2/STAT3 signaling,"Jie Luo, Keliang Wang, Shuyuan Yeh, Yin Sun, Liang Liang, Yao Xiao, Wanhai Xu, Yuanjie Niu, Liang Cheng, Sankar N. Maity, Runze Jiang, Chawnshang Chang",2019-06-12,"While the antiandrogen enzalutamide (Enz) extends the castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients’ survival an extra 4.8 months, it might also result in some adverse effects via inducing the neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). Here we found that lncRNA-p21 is highly expressed in the NEPC patients derived xenograft tissues (NEPC-PDX). Results from cell lines and human clinical sample surveys also revealed that lncRNA-p21 expression is up-regulated in NEPC and Enz treatment could increase the lncRNA-p21 to induce the NED. Mechanism dissection revealed that Enz could promote the lncRNA-p21 transcription via altering the androgen receptor (AR) binding to different androgen-response-elements, which switch the EZH2 function from histone-methyltransferase to non-histone methyltransferase, consequently methylating the STAT3 to promote the NED. Preclinical studies using the PDX mouse model proved that EZH2 inhibitor could block the Enz-induced NED. Together, these results suggest targeting the Enz/AR/lncRNA-p21/EZH2/STAT3 signaling may help urologists to develop a treatment for better suppression of the human CRPC progression.",
Immunostimulatory nanomedicines synergize with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy to eradicate colorectal tumors,"Xiaopin Duan, Christina Chan, Wenbo Han, Nining Guo, Ralph R. Weichselbaum, Wenbin Lin",2019-04-23,"Nanoparticles can potentially stimulate tumour microenvironments to elicit antitumour immunity. Herein, we demonstrate effective immunotherapy of colorectal cancer via systemic delivery of an immunostimulatory chemotherapeutic combination in nanoscale coordination polymer (NCP) core-shell particles. Oxaliplatin and dihydroartemesinin have contrasting physicochemical properties but strong synergy in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and anticancer activity. The combined ROS generation is harnessed for immune activation to synergize with an anti-PD-L1 antibody for the treatment of murine colorectal cancer tumours. The favourable biodistribution and tumour uptake of NCPs and the absence of peripheral neuropathy allow for repeated dosing to afford 100% tumour eradication. The involvement of innate and adaptive immune systems elicit strong and long lasting antitumour immunity which prevents tumour formation when cured mice are challenged with cancer cells. The intrinsically biodegradable, well tolerated, and systemically available immunostimulatory NCP promises to enter clinical testing as an immunotherapy against colorectal cancer.",
Gadd45g insufficiency drives the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms,"Peiwen Zhang, Na You, Yiyi Ding, Wenqi Zhu, Nan Wang, Yueqiao Xie, Wanling Huang, Qian Ren, Tiejun Qin, Rongfeng Fu, Lei Zhang, Zhijian Xiao, Tao Cheng, Xiaotong Ma",2024-04-06,"Despite the identification of driver mutations leading to the initiation of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), the molecular pathogenesis of MPNs remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gamma (GADD45g) is expressed at significantly lower levels in patients with MPNs, and JAK2V617F mutation and histone deacetylation contribute to its reduced expression. Downregulation of GADD45g plays a tumor-promoting role in human MPN cells. Gadd45g insufficiency in the murine hematopoietic system alone leads to significantly enhanced growth and self-renewal capacity of myeloid-biased hematopoietic stem cells, and the development of phenotypes resembling MPNs. Mechanistically, the pathogenic role of GADD45g insufficiency is mediated through a cascade of activations of RAC2, PAK1 and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. These data characterize GADD45g deficiency as a novel pathogenic factor in MPNs.",

In this nationwide cohort study, we assessed the association between medication use at breast cancer diagnosis and survival. We included 235,368 French women with newly diagnosed non-metastatic breast cancer. In analyzes of 288 medications, we identified eight medications positively associated with either overall survival or disease-free survival: rabeprazole, alverine, atenolol, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, estriol (vaginal or transmucosal), nomegestrol, and hypromellose; and eight medications negatively associated with overall survival or disease-free survival: ferrous fumarate, prednisolone, carbimazole, pristinamycin, oxazepam, alprazolam, hydroxyzine, and mianserin.

We identify a low degree of somatic mutation but widespread existence of copy number variations. We reveal predominant signature 2 mutations and frequent loss of type I interferon genes that are involved in the host-virus counteraction. Integrated analysis shows enrichment of genetic lesions affecting several critical pathways, including NF-κB, JAK/STAT, and cell cycle. Notably, multi-dimensional comparison unveils that pulmonary LELC resemble NPC but are clearly different from other lung cancers, natural killer/T-cell lymphoma or EBV-related gastric cancer in terms of genetic features. In all, our study illustrates a distinct genomic landscape of pulmonary LELC and provides a road map to facilitate genome-guided personalized treatment.",
Accelerated DNA replication fork speed due to loss of R-loops in myelodysplastic syndromes with SF3B1 mutation,"David Rombaut, Carine Lefèvre, Tony Rached, Sabrina Bondu, Anne Letessier, Raphael M.

Here we find that SF3B1-mutated MDS show reduced R-loop formation predominating in gene bodies associated with intron retention reduction, not found in U2AF1- or SRSF2-mutated MDS. Compared to erythroblasts from SRSF2- or U2AF1-mutated patients, SF3B1-mutated erythroblasts exhibit augmented DNA synthesis, accelerated replication forks, and single-stranded DNA exposure upon differentiation. Importantly, histone deacetylase inhibition using vorinostat restores R-loop formation, slows down DNA replication forks and improves SF3B1-mutated erythroblast differentiation. In conclusion, loss of R-loops with associated DNA replication stress represents a hallmark of SF3B1-mutated MDS ineffective erythropoiesis, which could be used as a therapeutic target.",
Genomic and epigenomic integrative subtypes of renal cell carcinoma in a Japanese cohort,"Akihiko Fukagawa, Natsuko Hama, Yasushi Totoki, Hiromi Nakamura, Yasuhito Arai, Mihoko Saito-Adachi, Akiko Maeshima, Yoshiyuki Matsui, Shinichi Yachida, Tetsuo Ushiku, Tatsuhiro Shibata",2023-12-16,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) comprises several histological types characterised by different genomic and epigenomic aberrations; however, the molecular pathogenesis of each type still requires further exploration. We perform whole-genome sequencing of 128 Japanese RCC cases of different histology to elucidate the significant somatic alterations and mutagenesis processes. We also perform transcriptomic and epigenomic sequencing to identify distinguishing features, including assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and methyl sequencing. Genomic analysis reveals that the mutational signature differs among the histological types, suggesting that different carcinogenic factors drive each histology. From the ATAC-seq results, master transcription factors are identified for each histology. Furthermore, clear cell RCC is classified into three epi-subtypes, one of which expresses highly immune checkpoint molecules with frequent loss of chromosome 14q. These genomic and epigenomic features may lead to the development of effective therapeutic strategies for RCC.",

BrainMETH predictions are supported by routine histopathologic evaluation. We further characterize and validate the most predictive genomic regions in a large cohort of brain tumors (n = 165) using quantitative-methylation-specific PCR.

We test functional dependence on each of these genes using RNAi in breast cancer and non-malignant cells, validating malignant cell selective dependence upon 37 of 130 genes. Further analysis reveals a cluster of 13 TNBC addiction genes frequently co-upregulated that includes genes regulating cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage response, and malignant cell selective mitotic genes.

Here, we explored its efficacy and mechanism of cell death in melanoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We found that DDA induced lethal autophagy in vitro and in vivo, including primary AML patient samples, independently of melanoma Braf status or AML molecular and cytogenetic classifications. DDA is a partial agonist on liver-X-receptor (LXR) increasing Nur77, Nor1, and LC3 expression leading to autolysosome formation. Moreover, DDA inhibited the cholesterol biosynthesizing enzyme 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ8,7-isomerase (D8D7I) leading to sterol accumulation and cooperating in autophagy induction. This mechanism of death was not observed with other LXR ligands or D8D7I inhibitors establishing DDA selectivity. The potent anti-tumor activity of DDA, its original mechanism of action and its low toxicity support its clinical evaluation. More generally, this study reveals that DDA can direct control a nuclear receptor to trigger lethal autophagy in cancers.",
Androgen receptor increases hematogenous metastasis yet decreases lymphatic metastasis of renal cell carcinoma,"Qingbo Huang, Yin Sun, Xin Ma, Yu Gao, Xintao Li, Yuanjie Niu, Xu Zhang, Chawnshang Chang",2017-10-13,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a gender-biased tumor. Here we report that there is also a gender difference between pulmonary metastasis and lymph node metastasis showing that the androgen receptor (AR)-positive ccRCC may prefer to metastasize to lung rather than to lymph nodes. A higher AR expression increases ccRCC hematogenous metastasis yet decreases ccRCC lymphatic metastases. Mechanism dissection indicates that AR enhances miR-185-5p expression via binding to the androgen response elements located on the promoter of miR-185-5p, which suppresses VEGF-C expression via binding to its 3′ UTR. In contrast, AR-enhanced miR-185-5p also promotes HIF2α/VEGF-A expression via binding to the promoter region of HIF2α. Together, these results provide a unique mechanism by which AR can either increase or decrease ccRCC metastasis at different sites and may help us to develop combined therapies using anti-AR and anti-VEGF-C compounds to better suppress ccRCC progression.",
In vivo optimization of the experimental conditions for the non-invasive optical assessment of breast density,"Nicola Serra, Rinaldo Cubeddu, Giulia Maffeis, Vamshi Damagatla, Antonio Pifferi, Paola Taroni",2024-08-19,"In this study, time domain diffuse optical spectroscopy is performed in the range 600–1100 nm on 11 healthy volunteers with a portable system for the quantitative characterization of breast tissue in terms of optical properties and optically-derived blood parameters, tissue constituent concentrations, and scattering parameters. A measurement protocol involving different geometries (reflectance and transmittance), subject’s positions (sitting and lying down), probing locations (outer, lower, and inner breast quadrants), and source-detector distances (2 and 3 cm) allowed us to investigate the effect of tissue heterogeneity and different measurement configurations on the results with the aim of identifying the best experimental conditions for the estimate of breast density (i.e., amount of fibro-glandular tissue in the breast) as a strong independent risk factor for breast cancer. Transmittance results, that in previous studies correlated strongly with mammographic density, are used as a reference for the initial test of the simpler and more comfortable reflectance measurement configuration. The higher source-detector distance, which probes deeper tissue, retrieves optical outcomes in agreement with higher average density tissue. Similarly, results on the outer quadrants indicate higher density than internal quadrants. These findings are coherent with breast anatomy since the concentration of dense fibro-glandular stroma is higher in deep tissue and towards the external portion of the breast, where the mammary gland is located. The dataset generated with this laboratory campaign is used to device an optimal measurement protocol for a future clinical trial, where optical results will be correlated with conventional mammographic density, allowing us to identify a subset of wavelengths and measurement configurations for an effective estimate of breast density. The final objective is the design of a simplified, compact and cost-effective optical device for a non-invasive, routine assessment of density-associated breast cancer risk.",
Lumpectomy without radiation for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: 20-year results from the ECOG-ACRIN E5194 study,"Jean L. Wright, Robert Gray, Habib Rahbar, Christopher E. Comstock, Judy A.

Wolff",2024-02-24,"We report the 20-year rate of ipsilateral breast event (IBE) for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with lumpectomy without radiation on a non-randomized prospective clinical trial. Patients were enrolled in cohort 1: low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, size ≤ 2.5 cm (n = 561); or cohort 2: high-grade DCIS, size ≤ 1 cm (n = 104). The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate time-to-event distributions. Cox proportional hazard methods were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and tests for significance for event times. 561 patients were enrolled in cohort 1 and 104 in cohort 2. After central pathology review, 26% in cohort 1 were recategorized as high-grade and 26% in cohort 2 as low- or intermediate-grade. Mean DCIS size was similar at 7.5 mm in cohort 1 and 7.8 mm in cohort 2. Surgical margin was ≥3 mm in 96% of patients, and about 30% received tamoxifen. Median follow-up was 19.2 years. There were 104 IBEs, of which 54 (52%) were invasive. The IBE and invasive IBE rates increased in both cohorts up to 15 years, then plateaued.

On multivariable analysis, IBE risk increased with size and was higher in cohort 2, but grade and margin width were not significantly associated with IBE. For patients with DCIS treated with excision without radiation, the rate of IBE increased with size and assigned cohort mostly in the first 15 years.",
Nomograms based on the lymphocyte–albumin–neutrophil ratio (LANR) for predicting the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients after definitive radiotherapy,"Sujuan Zhang, Zui Chen, Jie Ling, Yuhua Feng, Yangchun Xie, Xianling Liu, Chunhong Hu, Tao Hou",2024-03-05,"Much evidence has accumulated to show that inflammation and nutritional status are associated with the prognosis of patients with various cancers. The present study was designed to explore the prognostic role of the LANR in NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy and to construct a nomogram for predicting patient survival. This study retrospectively reviewed 805 NPC patients (604 in the training cohort and 201 in the validation cohort) who received definitive radiotherapy between January 2013 and December 2019. The clinical data and pretreatment laboratory test data, including lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, and serum ALB concentration, were collected for all patients. The LANR was calculated as the albumin × lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio. Patients in the training cohort and validation cohort were categorized into high-LANR and low-LANR groups according to the corresponding cutoff values. The independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and metastasis-free survival (MFS) were evaluated by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and a nomogram was subsequently constructed. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve. A low LANR (< 14.3) was independently associated with worse OS, PFS and MFS in NPC patients. A prognostic prediction nomogram was established based on T stage, N stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, treatment modality, and LANR and was validated. The C-indices of the nomograms for OS and PFS in the training cohort were 0.729 and 0.72, respectively. The C-indices of the nomograms for OS and PFS in the validation cohort were 0.694 and 0.695, respectively. The calibration curve revealed good consistency between the actual survival and the nomogram prediction. Patients with NPC with low pretreatment LANR had a poor prognosis. The nomogram established on the basis of the LANR was efficient and clinically useful for predicting survival in NPC patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy.","Lymphocyte, Neutrophil, Albumin, Nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Prognosis"
Explainable machine learning model for predicting paratracheal lymph node metastasis in cN0 papillary thyroid cancer,"Lin Chun, Denghuan Wang, Liqiong He, Donglun Li, Zhiping Fu, Song Xue, Xinliang Su, Jing Zhou",2024-09-27,"Prophylactic dissection of paratracheal lymph nodes in clinically lymph node-negative (cN0) papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains controversial. This study aims to integrate preoperative and intraoperative variables to compare traditional nomograms and machine learning (ML) models, developing and validating an interpretable predictive model for paratracheal lymph node metastasis (PLNM) in cN0 PTC patients. We retrospectively selected 3213 PTC patients treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from 2016 to 2020. They were randomly divided into the training and test datasets with a 7:3 ratio. The 533 PTC patients treated at the Guangyuan Central Hospital from 2019 to 2022 were used as an external test sets. We developed and validated nine ML models using 10-fold cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning. The predictive performance was evaluated using ROC curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration curves, and precision-recall curves. The best model was compared to a traditional logistic regression-based nomogram. The XGBoost model achieved AUC values of 0.935, 0.857, and 0.775 in the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, significantly outperforming the traditional nomogram model with AUCs of 0.85, 0.844, and 0.769, respectively. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based visualization identified the top 10 predictive features of the XGBoost model, and a web-based calculator was created based on these features. ML is a reliable tool for predicting PLNM in cN0 PTC patients. The SHAP method provides valuable insights into the XGBoost model, and the resultant web-based calculator is a clinically useful tool to assist in the surgical planning for paratracheal lymph node dissection.",

González-Carmona",2024-09-27,"Lenvatinib is a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TKI are suspected of exacerbating muscle loss in patients with cancer. In this study, we analyze the role of muscle loss in patients with advanced HCC treated with lenvatinib. This is a retrospective analysis of a real-life cohort of 25 patients with advanced HCC who were treated with lenvatinib from 2018 to March 2021 in Germany. Patients were stratified for loss of skeletal muscle area during the first three months of lenvatinib therapy. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity were analyzed for all patients, especially regarding loss of muscle before and during the first three months of therapy with lenvatinib. Three months after beginning of therapy with lenvatinib, a significant reduction of muscle mass was observed in 60% of patients (p = 0.035). Despite increase of loss of skeletal muscle, patients benefitted from lenvatinib in our cohort of patients in terms of OS and PFS and did not experience increased toxicity. Furthermore, muscle loss was not a negative predictor of survival in the univariate analysis (p = 0.675). Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma experience muscle loss with lenvatinib therapy. However, despite progressive muscle loss, patients benefit from a therapy with lenvatinib in terms of OS and PFS without increased toxicity. However, assessment and prophylaxis of skeletal muscle status should be recommended during a therapy with lenvatinib.",
Social determinants of health inequalities in early phase clinical trials in Northern England,"S. Rae, S. Shaya, E. Taylor, J. Hoben, D. Oluwashegun, H. Lowe, N. Haris, S. Bashir, C. Oing, M. G. Krebs, F. C. Thistlethwaite, L. Carter, N. Cook, A. Greystoke, D. M. Graham, R. Plummer",2024-06-24,"BackgroundEarly phase clinical trials in Oncology represent a subspecialised area where UK patient selection is influenced by access to Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres (ECMCs). Equity of access with respect to social determinants of health (SDoH) were explored for two major ECMCs.MethodsA retrospective cohort study including all referrals to Newcastle and Manchester ECMCs in 2021 was completed. Consent to screening or pre-screening was stratified against SDoH characteristics, including: Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) decile, ethnicity and distance to centre.Results1243 patients were referred for trials. IMD quintile 1 (most deprived) patients had reduced likelihood of referral compared to expected population models (OR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.80, p = <0.0001). IMD quintile 5 (least deprived) had increased likelihood of referral (OR, 1.46; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.82, p = 0.0007). Living beyond median distance from Manchester reduced the likelihood of consenting to trials (OR, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55 to 0.94, p = 0.015). Ethnicity data represented a White British propensity.ConclusionsInequalities in socioeconomic and geographic factors influence referral and enrolment to early phase clinical trials in Northern England. This has implications for equity of access and generalisability of trial results internationally and warrants further study.",

Improved detection and assessment of ICANS could improve management and allow greater utilization of CAR-T cell therapy, however, an objective, specific biomarker has not been identified. We hypothesized that the severity of ICANS can be quantified based on patterns of abnormal brain activity seen in electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We conducted a retrospective observational study of 120 CAR-T cell therapy patients who had received EEG monitoring. We determined a daily ICANS grade for each patient through chart review. We used visually assessed EEG features and machine learning techniques to develop the Visual EEG-Immune Effector Cell Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (VE-ICANS) score and assessed the association between VE-ICANS and ICANS. We also used it to determine the significance and relative importance of the EEG features. We developed the Visual EEG-ICANS (VE-ICANS) grading scale, a grading scale with a physiological basis that has a strong correlation to ICANS severity (R = 0.58 [0.47–0.66]) and excellent discrimination measured via area under the receiver operator curve (AUC = 0.91 for ICANS ≥ 2). This scale shows promise as a biomarker for ICANS which could help to improve clinical care through greater accuracy in assessing ICANS severity.",
Polarimetric biomarkers of peri-tumoral stroma can correlate with 5-year survival in patients with left-sided colorectal cancer,"Jigar Lad, Stefano Serra, Fayez Quereshy, Mohammadali Khorasani, Alex Vitkin",2022-07-25,"Using a novel variant of polarized light microscopy for high-contrast imaging and quantification of unstained histology slides, the current study assesses the prognostic potential of peri-tumoral collagenous stroma architecture in 32 human stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) patient samples. We analyze three distinct polarimetrically-derived images and their associated texture features, explore different unsupervised clustering algorithm models to group the data, and compare the resultant groupings with patient survival. The results demonstrate an appreciable total accuracy of ~ 78% with significant separation (p < 0.05) across all approaches for the binary classification of 5-year patient survival outcomes. Surviving patients preferentially belonged to Cluster 1 irrespective of model approach, suggesting similar stromal microstructural characteristics in this sub-population. The results suggest that polarimetrically-derived stromal biomarkers may possess prognostic value that could improve clinical management/treatment stratification in CRC patients.",
Study on novel neutron irradiation without beam shaping assembly in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy,"Antònia Verdera, Javier Praena",2024-09-28,"Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is performed using high-intensity neutron sources; however, the energy of the primary neutrons is too high for direct patient irradiation. Thus, neutron moderation is mandatory and is performed using a device known as a Beam Shaping Assembly (BSA). Due to the differences in flux and energy spectra between neutron sources, each facility needs a dedicated BSA design, whether it is based on a nuclear reactor or, more recently, on an accelerator. Since moderation involves the loss of neutrons, typically by a factor of 1000, it is necessary to generate a very high flux before neutrons pass through the BSA. We propose a novel approach that eliminates the necessity of a BSA, BSA-free, by generating neutrons suitable in flux and energy for direct patient irradiation through the \({}^{45}\)Sc(p,n)\({}^{45}\)Ti reaction using near-threshold protons. Our findings demonstrate that all IAEA quality factors for BNCT can be met with existing proton accelerators. Additionally, figures of merit studied provide similar results compared to real BNCT facilities. This breakthrough opens up new avenues in BNCT, among others, the control of the neutron penetration within the human body by small changing in the proton energy. Also, it is expected simplified accelerator-based facilities in terms of manufacturing and maintenance and operation. This work is a study based on experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations. Technical challenges and safety are addressed in Discussion section. This novel proposal is under evaluation as patent.","BNCT, Neutron production, IAEA quality factors, Dose, Therapeutic range"
"Comprehensive characterization of PTEN mutational profile in a series of 34,129 colorectal cancers","Ilya G. Serebriiskii, Valery Pavlov, Rossella Tricarico, Grigorii Andrianov, Emmanuelle Nicolas, Mitchell I. Parker, Justin Newberg, Garrett Frampton, Joshua E. Meyer, Erica A. Golemis",2022-03-25,"Loss of expression or activity of the tumor suppressor PTEN acts similarly to an activating mutation in the oncogene PIK3CA in elevating intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3), inducing signaling by AKT and other pro-tumorigenic signaling proteins. Here, we analyze sequence data for 34,129 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, capturing 3,434 PTEN mutations. We identify specific patterns of PTEN mutation associated with microsatellite stability/instability (MSS/MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), patient age, and tumor location. Within groups separated by MSS/MSI status, this identifies distinct profiles of nucleotide hotspots, and suggests differing profiles of protein-damaging effects of mutations. Moreover, discrete categories of PTEN mutations display non-identical patterns of co-occurrence with mutations in other genes important in CRC pathogenesis, including KRAS, APC, TP53, and PIK3CA. These data provide context for clinical targeting of proteins upstream and downstream of PTEN in distinct CRC cohorts.",
Glucocorticoids paradoxically promote steroid resistance in B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia through CXCR4/PLC signaling,"Souleymane Abdoul-Azize, Rihab Hami, Gaetan Riou, Céline Derambure, Camille Charbonnier, Jean-Pierre Vannier, Monica L. Guzman, Pascale Schneider, Olivier Boyer",2024-05-29,"Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance in childhood relapsed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) represents an important challenge. Despite decades of clinical use, the mechanisms underlying resistance remain poorly understood. Here, we report that in B-ALL, GC paradoxically induce their own resistance by activating a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated cell survival pathway through the chemokine receptor, CXCR4. We identify PLC as aberrantly activated in GC-resistant B-ALL and its inhibition is able to induce cell death by compromising several transcriptional programs. Mechanistically, dexamethasone (Dex) provokes CXCR4 signaling, resulting in the activation of PLC-dependent Ca2+ and protein kinase C signaling pathways, which curtail anticancer activity. Treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist or a PLC inhibitor improves survival of Dex-treated NSG mice in vivo. CXCR4/PLC axis inhibition significantly reverses Dex resistance in B-ALL cell lines (in vitro and in vivo) and cells from Dex resistant ALL patients. Our study identifies how activation of the PLC signalosome in B-ALL by Dex limits the upfront efficacy of this chemotherapeutic agent.",

CDH1 mutations (MT) are characteristic of genomically stable GC and are associated with poor prognosis, but lack effective or targeted therapies. Here, we showed the overall mutation frequency of CDH1 was 9.7% (155 of 1596). CDH1-MT GC showed significantly lower rates of PD-L1 positivity (CPS score ≥1) than CDH1-wildtype (WT) GC (56.7% vs. 73.3%, p < 0.05). Compared to CDH1-WT GC, mutations of ARID1A, WRN, POT1, CDK12, and FANCC were significantly higher, while TP53 and APC were significantly lower in CDH1-MT GC (p < 0.05); The rates of KRAS and HER2 amplifications were significantly lower, while CRKL and IGF1R amplifications were significantly higher in CDH1-MT GC, compared to CDH1-WT GC (p < 0.05). Frequently altered genes in CDH1-MT GC were especially enriched in DNA damage repair and cell cycle checkpoint pathways. Inhibition of E-cadherin sensitized GC cell lines to PARP and Wee1 inhibitors by disrupting DNA damage repair pathway and cell cycle checkpoint. This is the largest study to investigate the distinct genomic landscape of CDH1-MT GC. Our data indicated GC patients with CDH1 mutations could potentially benefit from agents targeting PARP and Wee1.",

Biopsies are typically sliced and evaluated as two-dimensional (2D) images. Biopsy sampling errors and the limited view provided by 2D histology are leading factors contributing to false-negative results in the preoperative detection of metastatic lymph nodes and underestimation of metastatic foci.In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to explore the technical feasibility and the potential capacities of tridimensional (3D) X-ray micro-computed tomography imaging to expedite error detection, enhancement of histopathological accuracy, and precise measurement of metastatic lesion on ALN core needle biopsies of two breast cancer patients. Our self-developed micro-CT protocol uses eosin for the first time, a common histological dye, to enhance 3D architecture of ALNs. Performed analysis on the images of the ALN biopsies involves cancer tissue segmentation, swift biopsy evaluation, and measurement of the metastatic longest diameter and deposit volume.The eosin micro-CT protocol shows potential for an improved tumor deposit estimates, offering additional clinical value compared to standard 2D histology, however, further studies for validating this method are needed.",

Primary endpoints are feasibility to resect no later than week 6 (phase Ib) and primary tumor pathological response (phase IIa). Surgery is not delayed or suspended for any patient in phase Ib, meeting the primary endpoint. Grade 3‒4 immune-related adverse events are seen in 2 of 6 (33%) NIVO MONO and 10 of 26 (38%) total COMBO patients. Pathological response, defined as the %-change in primary tumor viable tumor cell percentage from baseline biopsy to on-treatment resection, is evaluable in 17/20 phase IIa patients and 29/32 total trial patients (6/6 NIVO MONO, 23/26 COMBO). We observe a major pathological response (MPR, 90‒100% response) in 35% of patients after COMBO ICB, both in phase IIa (6/17) and in the whole trial (8/23), meeting the phase IIa primary endpoint threshold of 10%. NIVO MONO’s MPR rate is 17% (1/6). None of the MPR patients develop recurrent HSNCC during 24.0 months median postsurgical follow-up.

Breast cancer survivors’ opinion on personalizing endocrine therapy and developing informative tools,"Elie Rassy, Chiara Benvenuti, Sarra Akla, Antonio Di Meglio, Elise Martin, Julie Havas, André Rieutord, David Combarel, Léonor Fasse, Florian Scotté, Laure Guéroult Accolas, Guillemette Jacob, Anne Bergougnoux, Suzette Delaloge, Ines Vaz-Luis, Barbara Pistilli",2024-06-17,"Understanding breast cancer survivors’ perspectives is critical to personalizing endocrine therapy (ET) in the adjuvant setting. A nationwide survey among breast cancer survivors was proposed in France, in collaboration with patient advocacy organizations, to assess their perspectives on personalizing ET and developing dedicated informative tools. This survey explored patients’ preferences regarding ET intake schedule, formulation, presentation (color, taste, shape, size, design, and packaging), combination with agents targeting ET-related adverse events, and a mobile application to support them during ET. Of the 1103 individuals who started the survey, 939 (85.1%) were eligible for enrollment and completed the survey. The majority of the participants considered that a personalized ET should take into consideration the intake schedule (n = 974, 90.7%) and swallowable tablet formulation (n = 606, 64.5%), without a preference for ET presentation (n = 619; 65.9%). The majority of the participants expressed a willingness to participate in a potential clinical trial evaluating the combination of ET with agents targeting ET-related adverse events at the start of ET (n = 752, 80.1%) or in the case of major ET-related adverse events (n = 778, 82.8%). The primary considerations were to have an uncompromised ET efficacy and a guaranteed reduction of adverse events. Last, a dedicated mobile application was considered helpful by 665 participants (70.8%). Informative tools should focus on the recommendations for dealing with adverse events (n = 593, 63.2%), the impact on the patient’s daily life (n = 515, 54.9%), benefits (n = 504, 53.7%), and adverse events (n = 494, 52.6%) of ET. This survey paves the way for multimodal strategies that can include a personalized ET (e.g., ET in combination with agents targeting ET-related adverse events) and dedicated mobile applications to ultimately improve adherence.",
Comparison of robotic assisted and laparoscopic radical resection for rectal cancer with or without left colic artery preservation,"Mingrui Jiang, Jin Ji, Qi Zhang, Longhe Sun, Yong Ji, Jie Wang, Muhammad Ali, Qiannan Sun, Yong Wang, Bin Liu, Jun Ren, Liuhua Wang, Wei Wang, Dong Tang, Daorong Wang",2024-11-15,"The preservation of the left colic artery (LCA) during rectal cancer resection remains a topic of controversy, and there is a notable absence of robust evidence regarding the outcomes associated with LCA preservation. And the advantages of robotic-assisted laparoscopy (RAL) surgery in rectal resection remain uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of LCA preservation surgery and RAL surgery on intraoperative and postoperative complications of rectal cancer resection. Patients who underwent laparoscopic (LSC) or RAL with or without LCA preservation resection for rectal cancer between April 2020 and May 2023 were retrospectively assessed. The patients were categorized into two groups: low ligation (LL) which with preservation of LCA and high ligation (HL) which without preservation of LCA. A one-to-one propensity score-matched analysis was performed to decrease confounding. The primary outcome was operative findings, operative morbidity, and postoperative genitourinary function. A total of 612 patients were eligible for this study, and propensity score matching yielded 139 patients in each group. The blood loss of the LL group was significantly less than that of the HL group (54.42 ± 12.99 mL vs. 65.71 ± 7.37 mL, p<0.001). The urinary catheter withdrawal time in the LL group was significantly shorter than that in the HL group (4.87 ± 2.04 d vs. 6.06 ± 2.43d, p<0.001). Anastomotic leakage in the LL group was significantly lower than that in HL group (1.44% vs. 7.91%, p = 0.011). The rate of urinary dysfunction and sexual dysfunction in LL group is both significantly lower than HL group. Blood loss and number of harvested lymph nodes (LNs) of both RAL subgroups in LL and HL groups were significantly more than that in LSC subgroups. The anastomotic leakage in the RAL subgroup of HL group was significantly lower than that in LSC subgroup (0% vs. 14.89%, p = 0.018). LCA preservation surgery for rectal cancer may help reduce the blood loss, urinary catheter withdrawal time, the rate of anastomotic leakage and ileus, and postoperative genitourinary function outcomes. RAL can reduce the probability of blood loss and improve harvest LNs in patients with rectal cancer.","Rectal cancer, Left colic artery, High ligation, Low ligation, Inferior mesenteric artery, Robotic-assisted laparoscopy"
C5aR1 inhibition reprograms tumor associated macrophages and reverses PARP inhibitor resistance in breast cancer,"Xi Li, Alfonso Poire, Kang Jin Jeong, Dong Zhang, Tugba Yildiran Ozmen, Gang Chen, Chaoyang Sun, Gordon B. Mills",2024-05-27,"Although Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi) have been approved in multiple diseases, including BRCA1/2 mutant breast cancer, responses are usually transient requiring the deployment of combination therapies for optimal efficacy. Here we thus explore mechanisms underlying sensitivity and resistance to PARPi using two intrinsically PARPi sensitive (T22) and resistant (T127) syngeneic murine breast cancer models in female mice. We demonstrate that tumor associated macrophages (TAM) potentially contribute to the differential sensitivity to PARPi. By single-cell RNA-sequencing, we identify a TAM_C3 cluster, expressing genes implicated in anti-inflammatory activity, that is enriched in PARPi resistant T127 tumors and markedly decreased by PARPi in T22 tumors. Rps19/C5aR1 signaling is selectively elevated in TAM_C3. C5aR1 inhibition or transferring C5aR1hi cells increases and decreases PARPi sensitivity, respectively. High C5aR1 levels in human breast cancers are associated with poor responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Thus, targeting C5aR1 may selectively deplete pro-tumoral macrophages and engender sensitivity to PARPi and potentially other therapies.",
The thioredoxin system determines CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity via redox-mediated regulation of ribonucleotide reductase activity,"Chandra Bhushan Prasad, Adrian Oo, Yujie Liu, Zhaojun Qiu, Yaogang Zhong, Na Li, Deepika Singh, Xiwen Xin, Young-Jae Cho, Zaibo Li, Xiaoli Zhang, Chunhong Yan, Qingfei Zheng, Qi-En Wang, Deliang Guo, Baek Kim, Junran Zhang",2024-05-31,"Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is critical for cell survival under replication stress (RS). CHK1 inhibitors (CHK1i’s) in combination with chemotherapy have shown promising results in preclinical studies but have displayed minimal efficacy with substantial toxicity in clinical trials. To explore combinatorial strategies that can overcome these limitations, we perform an unbiased high-throughput screen in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line and identify thioredoxin1 (Trx1), a major component of the mammalian antioxidant-system, as a determinant of CHK1i sensitivity. We establish a role for redox recycling of RRM1, the larger subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), and a depletion of the deoxynucleotide pool in this Trx1-mediated CHK1i sensitivity. Further, the TrxR inhibitor auranofin, an approved anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug, shows a synergistic interaction with CHK1i via interruption of the deoxynucleotide pool. Together, we show a pharmacological combination to treat NSCLC that relies on a redox regulatory link between the Trx system and mammalian RNR activity.",

However, the limited number of tumor cells, especially from patients with early stage cancer, has hindered the widespread application of this technique. Hence, we developed a digital microfluidic system for drug screening using primary tumor cells and established a working protocol for precision medicine. Smart control logic was developed to increase the throughput of the system and decrease its footprint to parallelly screen three drugs on a 4 × 4 cm2 chip in a device measuring 23 × 16 × 3.5 cm3. We validated this method in an MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft mouse model and liver cancer specimens from patients, demonstrating tumor suppression in mice/patients treated with drugs that were screened to be effective on individual primary tumor cells. Mice treated with drugs screened on-chip as ineffective exhibited similar results to those in the control groups. The effective drug identified through on-chip screening demonstrated consistency with the absence of mutations in their related genes determined via exome sequencing of individual tumors, further validating this protocol. Therefore, this technique and system may promote advances in precision medicine for cancer treatment and, eventually, for any disease.",
Evaluation of the impact of systemic dexamethasone dosage on docetaxel-induced hand-foot syndrome in patients with breast cancer,"Yoshitaka Saito, Yoh Takekuma, Masato Takahashi, Tomohiro Oshino, Mitsuru Sugawara",2024-06-18,"Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a frequently occurring and treatment-requiring adverse effect of docetaxel. We previously reported that systemic dexamethasone (DEX) prevents the other docetaxel-induced adverse inflammatory effects in a dose-dependent manner. This study aimed to evaluate the dose-dependent efficacy of systemic DEX in attenuating HFS in patients with breast cancer receiving docetaxel. Patients with breast cancer receiving docetaxel (75 mg/m2)-containing regimens (n = 111) were divided into 4 and 8 mg/day DEX groups, with each DEX dose administered on days 2–4, and analyzed retrospectively. Development of all-grade HFS in all treatment cycles was significantly lower in the 8 mg group (50.0%) than in the 4 mg group (73.0%, P = 0.03), with primary endpoint accomplishment. Moreover, its development in the first cycle was also lower in the 8 mg group than in the 4 mg group. These results were confirmed in a propensity score-matched population. Logistic regression analysis suggested higher DEX dosage as an independent preventive factor (adjusted odds ratio 0.35; 95% confidence interval 0.14–0.86, P = 0.02 for all cycles; 0.26, 0.11–0.63, P = 0.003 for the first cycle).

Long-term outcomes following CAR T cell therapy: what we know so far,"Kathryn M. Cappell, James N. Kochenderfer",2023-04-13,"Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are engineered fusion proteins designed to target T cells to antigens expressed on cancer cells. CAR T cells are now an established treatment for patients with relapsed and/or refractory B cell lymphomas, B cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and multiple myeloma. At the time of this writing, over a decade of follow-up data are available from the initial patients who received CD19-targeted CAR T cells for B cell malignancies. Data on the outcomes of patients who received B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted CAR T cells for multiple myeloma are more limited owing to the more recent development of these constructs. In this Review, we summarize long-term follow-up data on efficacy and toxicities from patients treated with CAR T cells targeting CD19 or BCMA. Overall, the data demonstrate that CD19-targeted CAR T cells can induce prolonged remissions in patients with B cell malignancies, often with minimal long-term toxicities, and are probably curative for a subset of patients. By contrast, remissions induced by BCMA-targeted CAR T cells are typically more short-lived but also generally have only limited long-term toxicities. We discuss factors associated with long-term remissions, including the depth of initial response, malignancy characteristics predictive of response, peak circulating CAR levels and the role of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. We also discuss ongoing investigational strategies designed to improve the length of remission following CAR T cell therapy.",

Pyter",2024-11-15,"Chemotherapy frequently causes debilitating gastrointestinal symptoms, which are inadequately managed by current treatments. Recent research indicates the gut microbiome plays a role in the pathogenesis of these symptoms. The current study aimed to identify pre-chemotherapy microbiome markers that predict gastrointestinal symptom severity after breast cancer chemotherapy. Fecal samples, blood, and gastrointestinal symptom scores were collected from 59 breast cancer patients before, during, and after chemotherapy. Lower pre-chemotherapy microbiome alpha diversity and abundance of specific microbes (e.g., Faecalibacterium) predicted greater chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal symptoms. Notably, tumor and diet characteristics were associated with lower pre-chemotherapy alpha diversity. Lower baseline alpha diversity also predicted higher chemotherapy-induced microbiome disruption, which was positively associated with diarrhea symptoms. The results indicate certain cancer patients have lower microbiome diversity before chemotherapy, which is predictive of greater chemotherapy-induced gastrointestinal symptoms and a less resilient microbiome. These patients may be strong candidates for pre-chemotherapy microbiome-directed preventative interventions (e.g., diet change).",

Liver cancer holds the sixth position in terms of most frequently diagnosed cancers and stands as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2020, accounting for 905,677 new cases and 782,000 fatalities. Additionally, liver cancer contributed to 12,528,421 age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), with an age-standardized DALYs rate of 161.92 in 2019 worldwide. The age-specific incidence rates exhibited significant variations across different regions, showing a fivefold difference in males and females. A significant increase in incidence was observed in North Europe and Asia, while North African countries reported a higher mortality burden (ASR, 10 per 100,000) compared to developed countries. Since last few years, the incidence and mortality rates have increased and attained Annual Average Percentage Change (AAPC) incidence rate of 7.7 (95% CI 3.9–11.6) for men and the highest AAPC mortality rate of 12.2 (95% CI 9.5–15.0) for women. In 2019, Western Europe emerged as the high-risk region for DALYs related to smoking and alcohol consumption, while high-income North America carried a high risk for DALYs associated with a high body-mass index. The projected trend indicates a surge in new liver cancer incident cases, expected to rise from around 905,347 to an estimated 1,392,474 by 2040. This study described the evidence pertinent to higher incidence trends in liver  cancer,  particularly among both  young and older adults, encompassing males and females, as well as those who are HIV-infected and HBsAg positive. A significant rise in the young population poses a significant public health concern that warrants attention from healthcare professionals to prioritize the promotion of health awareness and the development of effective cancer prevention strategies, particularly in many developing countries.","Liver cancer, Gender, Age standardized mortality rate, 2040 Projections rates, HDI, WHO database, GBD database, CI5 volumes I–XI"
Gut microbiota in colorectal cancer development and therapy,"Chi Chun Wong, Jun Yu",2023-05-11,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the commonest cancers globally. A unique aspect of CRC is its intimate association with the gut microbiota, which forms an essential part of the tumour microenvironment. Research over the past decade has established that dysbiosis of gut bacteria, fungi, viruses and Archaea accompanies colorectal tumorigenesis, and these changes might be causative. Data from mechanistic studies demonstrate the ability of the gut microbiota to interact with the colonic epithelia and immune cells of the host via the release of a diverse range of metabolites, proteins and macromolecules that regulate CRC development. Preclinical and some clinical evidence also underscores the role of the gut microbiota in modifying the therapeutic responses of patients with CRC to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, we summarize our current understanding of the role of gut microbiota in CRC and outline the potential translational and clinical implications for CRC diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Emphasis is placed on how the gut microbiota could now be better harnessed by developing targeted microbial therapeutics as chemopreventive agents against colorectal tumorigenesis, as adjuvants for chemotherapy and immunotherapy to boost drug efficacy and safety, and as non-invasive biomarkers for CRC screening and patient stratification. Finally, we highlight the hurdles and potential solutions to translating our knowledge of the gut microbiota into clinical practice.",
Evaluation of dose delivery based on deformed CT using a commercial software for lung cancer,"Jihong Chen, Kaiqiang Chen, Min OuYang, Guohua Wang, Penggang Bai, Hongqiang You",2024-06-24,"This study employed a commercial software velocity to perform deformable registration and dose calculation on deformed CT images, aiming to assess the accuracy of dose delivery during the radiotherapy for lung cancers. A total of 20 patients with lung cancer were enrolled in this study. Adaptive CT (ACT) was generated by deformed the planning CT (pCT) to the CBCT of initial radiotherapy fraction, followed by contour propagation and dose recalculation. There was not significant difference between volumes of GTV and CTV calculated from the ACT and pCT. However, significant differences in dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and coverage ratio (CR) between GTV and CTV were observed, with lower values for GTV volumes below 15 cc. The mean differences in dose corresponding to 95% of the GTV, GTV-P, CTV, and CTV-P between ACT and pCT were − 0.32%, 4.52%, 2.17%, and 4.71%, respectively. For the dose corresponding to 99%, the discrepancies were − 0.18%, 8.35%, 1.92%, and 24.96%, respectively. These differences in dose primarily appeared at the edges of the target areas. Notably, a significant enhancement of dose corresponding to 1 cc for spinal cord was observed in ACT, compared with pCT. There was no statistical difference in the mean dose of lungs and heart. In general, for lung cancer patients, anatomical motion may result in both CTV and GTV moving outside the original irradiation region. The dose difference within the original target area was small, but the difference in the planning target area was considerable.","Deformable image registration, Lung cancer, CBCT, Adaptive radiotherapy"
"Assessment of malignant potential for HPV types 16, 52, and 58 in the uterine cervix within a Korean cohort","Juhun Lee, Dong Ja Kim, Hyun Jung Lee",2024-06-25,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is the primary carcinogen in uterine cervical carcinoma. While genotype-specific carcinogenic risks have been extensively studied in Western populations, data from Korean are sparse. This study evaluates the malignant potential of the three most prevalent HR-HPVs in Korea: HPV16, HPV52, and HPV58. We analyzed 230 patients who underwent cervical conization and had been tested for HPV within a year prior to the procedure, excluding those with multiple infections. This analysis was confined to patients with single HPV infections and assessed outcomes of CIN3+, which includes carcinoma in situ (CIN3) and invasive carcinoma. The incidence of invasive cervical cancer was 6.7% for HPV16, 1.7% for HPV52, and 2.0% for HPV58; however, these differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.187). The rate of CIN3+ for HPV16, HPV52, and HPV58 were 70.6%, 51.7%, and 58.8%, respectively. Despite the small sample size, which may limit the robustness of statistical analysis, the data suggest a higher observed risk with HPV16. These findings highlight the need for vigilant clinical management tailored to specific HPV genotypes and support the implementation of a nine-valent vaccine in Korea. Physicians should be aware of these genotype-specific risks when treating patients.","human papillomavirus, cervical pre-malignancy, malignant potential, risk of carcinogenesis, cervical cancer"
Development and validation of a prediction model for delayed recovery from anesthesia in elderly lung adenocarcinoma patients underwent thoracoscopic radical resection,"Qiang Li, Fuhai Xia, Xiaoshuang He, Qing Yan, Qiuling Wu, Chang Liu, Rui Chen, Jing Li",2024-11-14,"This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model based on real-world data to assess the risk of delayed recovery from anesthesia in elderly lung adenocarcinoma patients underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) radical resection. This study is a retrospective study of real-world data. A total of 257 elderly lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent VATS radical resection from January 2022 to December 2023 in a tertiary hospital in Wuhan were selected. Patients were divided into delayed recovery (n = 42) and non- delayed recovery group (n = 215) according to whether delayed recovery occurred after anesthesia. Lasso regression was used to screen the independent variables. Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of delayed recovery from anesthesia, and a nomogram model was established. Bootstrap method was used to internally verify the nomogram model. Delayed recovery from anesthesia occurred in 42 of 257 elderly lung adenocarcinoma patients underwent VATS radical resection (16.34%). Logistic regression analysis showed that anesthesia duration, intraoperative infusion volume, inhaled desflurane, preoperative respiratory tract infection, intraoperative hypothermia and diagnosed with hypertension were risk factors for delayed recovery from anesthesia in elderly lung adenocarcinoma patients underwent VATS radical resection (P < 0.05). The area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.869, 95% CI (0.815 ~ 0.923). The optimal cutoff value was 0.198, the sensitivity was 0.738, and the specificity was 0.823. Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that χ2 = 7.346, P = 0.500. The decision curve analysis results have shown that the threshold probability is between 0.23 and 0.91, and the net benefit rate of the model is good. The risk prediction model constructed in this study can provide reference for medical staff to screen precisely high-risk of delayed recovery from anesthesia in elderly lung adenocarcinoma patients underwent VATS radical resection, which is of great significance.","Delayed recovery, Anesthesia, Lung adenocarcinoma, Video-assisted thoracoscopic, Prediction model"
Multiregional transcriptomics identifies congruent consensus subtypes with prognostic value beyond tumor heterogeneity of colorectal cancer,"Jonas Langerud, Ina A. Eilertsen, Seyed H. Moosavi, Solveig M. K. Klokkerud, Henrik M. Reims, Ingeborg F. Backe, Merete Hektoen, Ole H. Sjo, Marine Jeanmougin, Sabine Tejpar, Arild Nesbakken, Ragnhild A. Lothe, Anita Sveen",2024-05-21,"Intra-tumor heterogeneity compromises the clinical value of transcriptomic classifications of colorectal cancer. We investigated the prognostic effect of transcriptomic heterogeneity and the potential for classifications less vulnerable to heterogeneity in a single-hospital series of 1093 tumor samples from 692 patients, including multiregional samples from 98 primary tumors and 35 primary-metastasis sets. We show that intra-tumor heterogeneity of the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) is frequent and has poor-prognostic associations independently of tumor microenvironment markers. Multiregional transcriptomics uncover cancer cell-intrinsic and low-heterogeneity signals that recapitulate the intrinsic CMSs proposed by single-cell sequencing. Further subclassification identifies congruent CMSs that explain a larger proportion of variation in patient survival than intra-tumor heterogeneity. Plasticity is indicated by discordant intrinsic phenotypes of matched primary and metastatic tumors. We conclude that multiregional sampling reconciles the prognostic power of tumor classifications from single-cell and bulk transcriptomics in the context of intra-tumor heterogeneity, and phenotypic plasticity challenges the reconciliation of primary and metastatic subtypes.",
Priming with LSD1 inhibitors promotes the persistence and antitumor effect of adoptively transferred T cells,"Fengqi Qiu, Peishan Jiang, Guiheng Zhang, Jie An, Kexin Ruan, Xiaowen Lyu, Jianya Zhou, Wanqiang Sheng",2024-05-21,"The antitumor efficacy of adoptively transferred T cells is limited by their poor persistence, in part due to exhaustion, but the underlying mechanisms and potential interventions remain underexplored. Here, we show that targeting histone demethylase LSD1 by chemical inhibitors reshapes the epigenome of in vitro activated and expanded CD8+ T cells, and potentiates their antitumor efficacy. Upon T cell receptor activation and IL-2 signaling, a timely and transient inhibition of LSD1 suffices to improve the memory phenotype of mouse CD8+ T cells, associated with a better ability to produce multiple cytokines, resist exhaustion, and persist in both antigen-dependent and -independent manners after adoptive transfer. Consequently, OT1 cells primed with LSD1 inhibitors demonstrate an enhanced antitumor effect in OVA-expressing solid tumor models implanted in female mice, both as a standalone treatment and in combination with PD-1 blockade. Moreover, priming with LSD1 inhibitors promotes polyfunctionality of human CD8+ T cells, and increases the persistence and antitumor efficacy of human CD19-CAR T cells in both leukemia and solid tumor models. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 could be exploited to improve adoptive T cell therapy.",
"First-line penpulimab (an anti-PD1 antibody) and anlotinib (an angiogenesis inhibitor) with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine (PAAG) in metastatic pancreatic cancer: a prospective, multicentre, biomolecular exploratory, phase II trial","Huizi Sha, Fan Tong, Jiayao Ni, Yi Sun, Yahui Zhu, Liang Qi, Xiaoqin Li, Wei Li, Yan Yang, Qing Gu, Xing Zhang, Xiaoxuan Wang, Chan Zhu, Dongsheng Chen, Baorui Liu, Juan Du",2024-06-07,"Metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC) has a dismal prognosis. Herein, we conducted a prospective, multicentre, single-arm, phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of penpulimab and anlotinib in combination with nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine (PAAG) in patients with first-line mPC (NCT05493995). The primary endpoints included the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR), while secondary endpoints encompassed progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. In 66 patients analysed for efficacy, the best response, indicated by the ORR, was recorded at 50.0% (33/66) (95% CI, 37.4–62.6%), with 33 patients achieving partial response (PR). Notably, the DCR was 95.5% (63/66, 95% CI, 87.3–99.1%). The median PFS (mPFS) and OS (mOS) were 8.8 (95% CI, 8.1–11.6), and 13.7 (95% CI, 12.4 to not reached) months, respectively. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were reported in 39.4% of patients (26/66). In prespecified exploratory analysis, patients with altered SWI/SNF complex had a poorer PFS. Additionally, low serum CA724 level, high T-cell recruitment, low Th17 cell recruitment, and high NK CD56dim cell scores at baseline were potential predicative biomarkers for more favourable efficacy. In conclusion, PAAG as a first-line therapy demonstrated tolerability with promising clinical efficacy for mPC. The biomolecular findings identified in this study possess the potential to guide the precise clinical application of the triple-combo regimen.",
KMT2C deficiency promotes small cell lung cancer metastasis through DNMT3A-mediated epigenetic reprogramming,"Feifei Na, Xiangyu Pan, Jingyao Chen, Xuelan Chen, Manli Wang, Pengliang Chi, Liting You, Lanxin Zhang, Ailing Zhong, Lei Zhao, Siqi Dai, Mengsha Zhang, Yiyun Wang, Bo Wang, Jianan Zheng, Yuying Wang, Jing Xu, Jian Wang, Baohong Wu, Mei Chen, Hongyu Liu, Jianxin Xue, Meijuan Huang, Youling Gong, Jiang Zhu, Lin Zhou, Yan Zhang, Min Yu, Panwen Tian, Mingyu Fan, Zhenghao Lu, Zhihong Xue, Yinglan Zhao, Hanshuo Yang, Chengjian Zhao, Yuan Wang, Junhong Han, Shengyong Yang, Dan Xie, Lu Chen, Qian Zhong, Musheng Zeng, Scott W. Lowe, You Lu, Yu Liu, Yuquan Wei, Chong Chen",2022-04-21,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is notorious for its early and frequent metastases, which contribute to it as a recalcitrant malignancy. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC metastasis, we generated SCLC mouse models with orthotopically transplanted genome-edited lung organoids and performed multiomics analyses. We found that a deficiency of KMT2C, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase frequently mutated in extensive-stage SCLC, promoted multiple-organ metastases in mice. Metastatic and KMT2C-deficient SCLC displayed both histone and DNA hypomethylation. Mechanistically, KMT2C directly regulated the expression of DNMT3A, a de novo DNA methyltransferase, through histone methylation. Forced DNMT3A expression restrained metastasis of KMT2C-deficient SCLC through repressing metastasis-promoting MEIS/HOX genes. Further, S-(5′-adenosyl)-l-methionine, the common cofactor of histone and DNA methyltransferases, inhibited SCLC metastasis. Thus, our study revealed a concerted epigenetic reprogramming of KMT2C- and DNMT3A-mediated histone and DNA hypomethylation underlying SCLC metastasis, which suggested a potential epigenetic therapeutic vulnerability.",
AI tool for predicting MGMT methylation in glioblastoma for clinical decision support in resource limited settings,"Felipe Cicci Farinha Restini, Tarraf Torfeh, Souha Aouadi, Rabih Hammoud, Noora Al-Hammadi, Maria Thereza Mansur Starling, Cecília Felix Penido Mendes Sousa, Anselmo Mancini, Leticia Hernandes Brito, Fernanda Hayashida Yoshimoto, Nildevande Firmino Lima-Júnior, Marcello Moro Queiroz, Ula Lindoso Passos, Camila Trolez Amancio, Jorge Tomio Takahashi, Daniel De Souza Delgado, Samir Abdallah Hanna, Gustavo Nader Marta, Wellington Furtado Pimenta Neves-Junior",2024-11-14,"Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain cancer with a poor prognosis. The O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene methylation status is crucial for treatment stratification, yet economic constraints often limit access. This study aims to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) framework for predicting MGMT methylation. Diagnostic magnetic resonance (MR) images in public repositories were used for training. The algorithm created was validated in data from a single institution. All images were segmented according to widely used guidelines for radiotherapy planning and combined with clinical evaluations from neuroradiology experts. Radiomic features and clinical impressions were extracted, tabulated, and used for modeling. Feature selection methods were used to identify relevant phenotypes. A total of 100 patients were used for training and 46 for validation. A total of 343 features were extracted. Eight feature selection methods produced seven independent predictive frameworks. The top-performing ML model was a model post-Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) feature selection reaching accuracy (ACC) of 0.82, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81, a recall of 0.75, and a precision of 0.75. This study demonstrates that integrating clinical and radiotherapy-derived AI-driven phenotypes can predict MGMT methylation.

Influence of higher body mass index on postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients following thoracic surgery for lung cancer: a propensity score-matched cohort study,"Nan Zhang, Di Feng, Wei Wu, Ji Liu, Hong Shi",2024-06-16,"This study aimed to quantify the association between body mass index (BMI) and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) within the initial 48 h following thoracic surgery for lung cancer. We then explored whether changes in serum inflammatory factor concentrations were related to BMI during the early postoperative period. We conducted a propensity score-matched (PSM), retrospective cohort study at a specialized tertiary medical center. A total of 194 patients aged 18–80 years who underwent thoracic surgery for lung cancer at Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital between January and June 2021 were enrolled. The primary outcome was the incidence of PONV during the first 48 h after surgery. Nausea, vomiting or retching at different time periods, severe pain, and concentrations of perioperative serum inflammatory factors including CRP, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-γ were also assessed. Patients in the high BMI group (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) had a lower incidence of PONV than those in the normal BMI group (18.5–25 kg/m2) within the first 48 h after surgery (22 vs. 50%, p = 0.004). The incidence of nausea was lower at 0–12 h (14.5 vs. 37.1%, p = 0.004) and 12–24 h (8.1 vs. 22.6%, p = 0.025) in the high BMI group after surgery, and the incidence of vomiting was lower at 0–12 h (12.9 vs. 30.6%, p = 0.017) in higher BMI after surgery. We found no significant difference in the incidence of severe pain [severe static pain (p = 0.697) and severe dynamic pain (p = 0.158)]. Moreover, higher concentrations of IL-12 (2.24 ± 2.67 pg/ml vs. 1.48 ± 1.14 pg/ml, p = 0.048) and IFN-γ [1.55 (1.00) pg/ml vs. 1.30 (0.89) pg/ml, p = 0.041] were observed in patients with normal BMI on the first day after surgery. Given this finding, patients with a normal BMI should receive more attention for the prevention of PONV than those with a high BMI following thoracic surgery for lung cancer.Trial registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn and ChiCTR2100052380 (24/10/2021).","Body mass index, Postoperative nausea and vomiting, Thoracic surgery, Lung cancer, Pain, Cytokine"
Phenotypical differences of neutrophils patrolling tumour-draining lymph nodes in head and neck cancer,"Sandra Ekstedt, Krzysztof Piersiala, Aeneas Kolev, Pedro Farrajota Neves da Silva, Gregori Margolin, Susanna Kumlien Georén, Lars-Olaf Cardell",2024-11-14,"BackgroundThe complexity and heterogeneity of neutrophils are recognized, especially their roles in modulating inflammation and cancer immune responses.

A substantial fraction of neutrophils displayed an activated CD16highCD62Ldim profile in TDLNs, more prominent in patients with advanced T stages, implicating their involvement in the disease’s progression. Notably, the presence of this activated neutrophil phenotype in TDLNs was strongly associated with poorer patient prognosis.ConclusionsThe study confirms the heterogeneity of neutrophils in human TDLNs, aligning with findings from animal models but extending them to show clinical relevance in human disease. The correlation of neutrophil phenotypes with cancer progression and prognosis emphasizes the importance of these cells in the tumour-microenvironment.

Overweight is the main behavioral risk factor associated with colorectal cancer mortality in the Brazilian population: an ecological analysis,"Jonas Eduardo Monteiro dos Santos, Marina Campos Araújo, Cosme Marcelo Furtado Passos da Silva",2024-11-15,"Colorectal cancer in Brazil is among the main public health concern. The burden of disease can be related to unhealthy lifestyle behavior and inequality in access to health services. The aim of this study was to identify the main factors associated with colorectal cancer mortality in Brazil. This is an ecological study that had the Brazilian Federal Units as the primary units of analysis. Colorectal cancer mortality data (ICD C18-C21) were obtained from Brazilian national mortality system to the year 2020. Prevalence of overweight, food consumption (fiber, whole grains and red meat), physical inactivity, smoke, alcohol consumption, the median of household income, years of study, rates of cancer treatment units and oncologist by Brazilian Federal Units were considered as factor associated to the colorectal cancer mortality. Quasipoisson Generalized Linear Models were used to associate CRC mortality and variables related to dietary intake, risk behavior, and access to health services. In 2020, there were 21,501 deaths by colorectal cancer (51% among women). Prevalence of overweight (men: IRR 1.03; CI: 1.01–1.04; women IRR 1.05; CI 1.02–1.08) and the density of oncologist (men: IRR 1.02; CI: 1.01–1.03; women IRR 1.02; CI 1.01–1.03) were the main factors associated with colorectal cancer mortality. Sociodemographic and food consumption characteristics were not statistically associated with CRC. Prevalence of overweight was the strongest factor associated with mortality from colorectal cancer in Brazil in 2020. Therefore, current public policies to reduce overweight and obesity should be prioritized and strengthened in Brazil.","Colorectal cancer, Overweight, Food consumption, Mortality"
In silico analysis unveiling potential biomarkers in gallbladder carcinogenesis,"Raviranjan Kumar Gupta, Ravi Bhushan, Saket Kumar, Shyam Babu Prasad",2024-06-24,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare but very aggressive most common digestive tract cancer with a high mortality rate due to delayed diagnosis at the advanced stage. Moreover, GBC progression shows asymptomatic characteristics making it impossible to detect at an early stage. In these circumstances, conventional therapy like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy becomes refractive. However, few studies reported some molecular markers like KRAS (Kirsten Rat Sarcoma) mutation, upregulation of HER2/neu, EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and microRNAs in GBC. However, the absence of some specific early diagnostic and prognostic markers is the biggest hurdle for the therapy of GBC to date. The present study has been designed to identify some specific molecular markers for precise diagnosis, and prognosis, for successful treatment of the GBC. By In Silico a network-centric analysis of two microarray datasets; (GSE202479) and (GSE13222) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, shows 50 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with GBC. Further network analysis revealed that 12 genes are highly interconnected based on the highest MCODE (Molecular Complex Detection) value, among all three genes; TRIP13 (Thyroid Receptor Interacting Protein), NEK2 (Never in Mitosis gene-A related Kinase 2), and TPX2 (Targeting Protein for Xklp2) having highest network interaction with transcription factors and miRNA suggesting critically associated with GBC. Further survival analysis data corroborate the association of these genes; TRIP13, NEK2, and TPX2 with GBC. Thus, TRIP13, NEK2, and TPX2 genes are significantly correlated with a greater risk of mortality, transforming them from mere biomarkers of the GBC for early detections and may emerge as prognostic markers for treatment.","Gallbladder cancer (GBC), Biomarkers, Network analysis, TRIP13, NEK2, TPX2, Prognosis, Diagnosis, Treatment, Therapeutic targets"
Downhill running does not alter blood C1q availability or complement-dependent cytotoxicity of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against haematological cancer cell lines in vitro,"Harrison D. Collier-Bain, Frankie F. Brown, Adam J. Causer, Lois Ross, Daniela Rothschild-Rodriguez, Noah Browne, Rachel Eddy, Kirstie L. Cleary, Juliet C. Gray, Mark S. Cragg, Sally Moore, James Murray, James E. Turner, John P. Campbell",2024-11-15,"Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is a primary mechanism-of-action of monoclonal antibody (mAb) immunotherapies used to treat haematological cancers, including rituximab and daratumumab. However, mAb efficacy may be limited by reduced bioavailability of complement C1q – which activates the complement classical pathway following interactions with mAb-opsonised target cells. C1q is secreted by phagocytes upon recruitment to sites of muscle damage to facilitate muscular repair, hence we hypothesised that muscle damaging exercise may increase C1q ‘spill-over’ into blood. Additionally, other complement proteins (e.g., C1s) have been reported to increase following ultra-endurance and resistance exercise. Taken together, we hypothesised that muscle damaging exercise could be harnessed to enhance mAb-mediated CDC. In this study, n = 8 healthy males (28 ± 5-years) completed two 45-minute treadmill running protocols: (1) a flat running protocol at a speed 15% above anaerobic threshold, and (2) a downhill running protocol (− 10% slope) at the same speed. Blood samples were collected before, immediately after, and 1-hour, 24-hours, 2-days, and 4-days after exercise. Isolated serum was assessed for C1q by ELISA, and used to measure mAb (rituximab, daratumumab) mediated CDC against two haematological cancer cell lines (Raji, RPMI-8226) in vitro. Isolated plasma was assessed for markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]), and muscle damage (creatine kinase [CK]) by turbidimetry. C1q and CDC activity were not different between running protocols and did not change over time (p > 0.05). Significantly greater perceived muscle soreness (p < 0.001) and fluctuations observed from baseline to 24-hours post-exercise in the downhill running trial in CK (+ 171%) and CRP (+ 66%) suggests some degree of muscle damage was present. It is possible that any increase in C1q post-exercise may have been masked by the increase and subsequent interaction with CRP, which utilises C1q to facilitate muscular repair. This is the first study to investigate whether exercise can increase circulating C1q and improve mAb-mediated CDC and our findings show that downhill running exercise does not increase circulating C1q nor improve CDC in vitro.","Complement-dependent cytotoxicity, Immunotherapy, Exercise, Muscle damage, Complement C1q"
MHC class II genotypes are independent predictors of anti-PD1 immunotherapy response in melanoma,"Arne Claeys, Jimmy Van den Eynden",2024-09-30,"BackgroundImmune checkpoint blockade is a highly successful anti-cancer immunotherapy. Both CTLA4 and PD1 checkpoint blockers are clinically available for melanoma treatment, with anti-PD1 therapy reaching response rates of 35-40%. These responses, which are mediated via neoantigen presentation by the polymorphic MHC complex, are hard to predict and the tumor mutation burden is currently one of the few available biomarkers. While MHC genotypes are expected to determine therapy responses, association studies have remained largely elusive.MethodsWe developed an overall MHC genotype binding score (MGBS), indicative of a patient’s MHC class I (MHC-I) and class II (MHC-II) neoantigen binding capacity and solely based on the germline MHC-I (MGBS-I) and MHC-II (MGBS-II) genotypes. These scores were then correlated to survival and clinical responses following anti-PD1 immunotherapy in a previously published dataset of 144 melanoma patients.ResultsWe demonstrate that MGBS scores are TMB-independent predictors of anti-PD1 immunotherapy responses in melanoma. Opposite outcomes were found for both MHC classes, with high MGBS-I and MGBS-II predicting good and bad outcomes, respectively. Interestingly, high MGBS-II is mainly associated with treatment response failure in a subgroup of anti-CTLA4 pretreated patients.ConclusionsOur results suggest that MGBS, calculated solely from the MHC genotype, has clinical potential as a non-invasive and tumor-independent biomarker to guide anti-cancer immunotherapy in melanoma.",

Most molecular classifications relate only indirectly to the therapeutically relevant protein level. We improve the pre-analytics of clinical samples for proteome analyses and characterize a cohort of 434 samples with 242 tumors and 192 paired normal mucosae covering the full range of UC. We evaluate sample-wise tumor specificity and rank biomarkers by target relevance. We identify robust proteomic subtypes with prognostic information independent from histopathological groups. In silico drug prediction suggests efficacy of several compounds hitherto not in clinical use. Both in silico and in vitro data indicate predictive value of the proteomic clusters for these drugs. We underline that proteomics is relevant for personalized oncology and provide abundance and tumor specificity data for a large part of the UC proteome (www.cancerproteins.org).,

HCC cells are the core driving force of taming tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with pro-tumorigenic phenotypes for favor its dominant growth. Remarkably, M1-types TAMs had been characterized by disturbance of metabolism, poor antigen-presentation and immune-killing abilities. Besides, we found simultaneous cirrhotic and HCC lesions in an individual patient shared common origin and displayed parallel clone evolution via driving disparate immune reprograms for better environmental adaptation. Moreover, endothelial cells exhibited phenotypically conserved but executed differential functions in a space-dependent manner.

However, their clinical translation is limited by the lack of effective target identification and stringent testing in pre-clinical models that replicate standard treatment in GBM patients. In this study, we show the detection of cell surface death receptor (DR) target on CD146-enriched circulating tumor cells (CTC) captured from the blood of mice bearing GBM and patients diagnosed with GBM. Next, we developed allogeneic “off-the-shelf” clinical-grade bifunctional mesenchymal stem cells (MSCBif) expressing DR-targeted ligand and a safety kill switch. We show that biodegradable hydrogel encapsulated MSCBif (EnMSCBif) has a profound therapeutic efficacy in mice bearing patient-derived invasive, primary and recurrent GBM tumors following surgical resection. Activation of the kill switch enhances the efficacy of MSCBif and results in their elimination post-tumor treatment which can be tracked by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This study establishes a foundation towards a clinical trial of EnMSCBif in primary and recurrent GBM patients.",
The impact of ZTE-based MR attenuation correction compared to CT-AC in 18F-FBPA PET before boron neutron capture therapy,"Yi-Wen Lo, Ko-Han Lin, Chien-Ying Lee, Chia-Wei Li, Chien-Yuan Lin, Yi-Wei Chen, Ling-Wei Wang, Yuan-Hung Wu, Wen-sheng Huang",2024-06-17,"Tumor-to-normal ratio (T/N) measurement of 18F-FBPA is crucial for patient eligibility to receive boron neutron capture therapy. This study aims to compare the difference in standard uptake value ratios on brain tumors and normal brains using PET/MR ZTE and atlas-based attenuation correction with the current standard PET/CT attenuation correction. Regarding the normal brain uptake, the difference was not significant between PET/CT and PET/MR attenuation correction methods. The T/N ratio of PET/CT-AC, PET/MR ZTE-AC and PET/MR AB-AC were 2.34 ± 0.95, 2.29 ± 0.88, and 2.19 ± 0.80, respectively. The T/N ratio comparison showed no significance using PET/CT-AC and PET/MR ZTE-AC. As for the PET/MRI AB-AC, significantly lower T/N ratio was observed (− 5.18 ± 9.52%; p < 0.05). The T/N difference between ZTE-AC and AB-AC was also significant (4.71 ± 5.80%; p < 0.01). Our findings suggested PET/MRI imaging using ZTE-AC provided superior quantification on 18F-FBPA-PET compared to atlas-based AC. Using ZTE-AC on 18F-FBPA-PET /MRI might be crucial for BNCT pre-treatment planning.","PET/MR, PET/CT, ZTE, Attenuation correction, BNCT, FBPA"
Genetic variation perspective reveals potential drug targets for subtypes of endometrial cancer,"Jiamei Zhu, Ting Zhang, Juan Jiang, Mei Yang, Nan Xia, Youguo Chen",2024-11-15,"The study aims to identify potential drug targets for endometrial cancer (EC) subtypes through a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, assessing their clinical relevance. We utilized genetic instruments for 4,907 plasma proteins from the deCODE Genetics study dataset, and data with EC (n = 12,906) from a genome-wide study (GWAS) meta-analysis in European populations for MR analyses. Complementary analyses included protein-protein interactions (PPI) network analysis, therapeutic efficacy evaluation, differential gene expression assessment, and prognosis evaluation. The expression levels of key drug targets were quantitatively measured at both the transcriptional and translational stages utilizing reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Additionally, we analyzed various clinicopathological features. Five drug targets for EC (CBR3, GSTO1, HHIP, IGF2R, and MMP10), seven for endometrioid subtypes (ACAP2, CBR3, GSTO1, HHIP, IGF2R, MMP10, and TLR2), and seven for non-endometrioid subtypes (CST3, DNAJB14, FSTL5, GMPR2, IFI16, MAPK9, and NEO1) were identified. Among these, IGF2R (OR = 1.165; 95% CI 1.067–1.272; p = 1.046 × 10− 2) and CST3 (OR = 0.523; 95% CI 0.339–0.804; p = 7.010 × 10− 3) were highlighted as key drug targets with causal evidence both at transcriptional and translational levels. This study preliminarily confirms that IGF2R and CST3 may serve as novel targets for the treatment of EC, providing a foundational reference for innovative clinical approaches to this disease.","Endometrial cancer, Protein, Drug target, Mendelian randomization"
Proteomic profile of the antibody diversity in circulating extracellular vesicles of lung adenocarcinoma,"Xinfu Huang, Lijuan Xiong, Yang Zhang, Xin Peng, Hongping Ba, Peng Yang",2024-11-14,"Immunoglobulin diversity encompasses B-cell receptor, T-cell receptor, and antibody diversity. Existing studies have focused more on the role of B-cell and T-cell receptor diversity in tumor immunity, while the role of antibody diversity is less understood. This study examined and compared the blood extracellular vesicles (EVs) of lung cancer patients and healthy individuals using proteomics and bioinformatics analyses. The results revealed that among the 270 identified proteins, those involved in defense mechanisms were the most abundant. Most of these were antibody subtypes, accounting for 50.00%. Similarly, of the 40 identified EVs differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), 29 were involved in defense mechanisms (72.50%), with a higher proportion being antibody subtypes (82.76%). Furthermore, 24 DEP antibody subtypes were implicated in 18 immune reaction-related signaling pathways. These findings suggest that human serum EVs contain a significant number of antibody subtypes, and the antibody subtypes from lung cancer serum EVs differ from those of healthy controls (HCs). The variations in antibody diversity may be closely associated with lung cancer tumor immunity.","Lung adenocarcinoma, Plasma extracellular vesicles, Proteomics, Antibody diversity, Tumor immune"
Tumor suppressor ACER1 correlates with prognosis and Immune Infiltration in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,"Zhixin Liu, Xiaoqi Yang, Shuai Chen, Wenming Jia, Ye Qian, Minfa Zhang, Tianhe Fang, Heng Liu, Hui Yang",2024-11-14,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is notorious for poor prognoses, and effective biomarkers are urgently needed for early diagnosis of HNSCC patients. We investigate the role of alkaline ceramidase 1 (ACER1) and its relationship with immune infiltration in HNSCC. The differential expression and clinical prognostic significance of ACER1 in HNSCC patients are explored using bioinformatics methods and verified in human HNSCC samples. Genetic mutation, DNA methylation and drug sensitivity linked with ACER1 are examined. The potential biological function of ACER1 co-expression genes is assessed, and a series of functional assays are performed on ACER1in vitro. The results comprehensively reveal a relationship between ACER1 and immune infiltration in HNSCC patients. ACER1 expression is significantly downregulated in HNSCC tissues and closely correlated with better prognoses for HNSCC patients, and this prognostic significance is determined by distinct clinical characteristics. Genetic alteration and promoter hypomethylation of ACER1 are involved in progression of HNSCC, and ACER1 expression is significantly related to several drug sensitivities. Functional analysis shows that ACER1 co-expression genes are mainly enriched in the sphingolipid signaling pathway associated with inhibition of tumorigenesis, leading to better prognoses for HNSCC patients. In vitro, ACER1 overexpression inhibits proliferation and migration, induces apoptosis, and promotes adhesion of Fadu and SCC9 cells. In addition, high ACER1 expression is closely linked with infiltration levels of immune cells, and strongly associated with biomarkers of immune cells in HNSCC, suggesting the important role of ACER1 in regulating tumor immunity in HNSCC patients. In summary, ACER1 may be a useful indicator for diagnosis and prognosis, and may regulate immune infiltration in HNSCC patients, thus promising targeted immunotherapy for HNSCC.","HNSCC, ACER1, Prognosis, Biomarker, Immune infiltration"
"A systematic review on the techniques, long-term outcomes, and complications of partial breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for early-stage breast cancer","Jing Ning, Guanghui Cheng, Ning Wu",2024-09-27,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of four techniques of partial breast irradiation (PBI) including interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT), balloon-based brachytherapy (BBT), Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) in the treatment for early-stage breast cancer patients after breast-conserving surgery. A systematic search was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines using the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criteria were clinical trials and observational studies that reported on outcome measures of principal PBI techniques. The methodological quality of the included research data was assessed using bias risk assessment tool with the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS), and the research information were analyzed using data analysis software. Clinical studies were collected from the earliest available date until September 2023. Fifty-one studies were included, with a total sample size of 7708. The results of network meta-analysis (NMA) showed that ISBT can lower the local recurrence (SUCRA: 73.8%). In terms of reducing distant metastasis, 3DCRT may be the best choice (SUCRA: 52.5%). And IORT has the highest 5-year overall survival (SUCRA: 90%). Furthermore, ISBT also has the advantages of lowest risk with fat necrosis (SUCRA: 72.5%), infection (SUCRA: 78.3%) and breast pain (SUCRA: 86.2%). BBT may be the optimal solution for fibrosis (SUCRA: 76.9%) and hyperpigmentation (SUCRA: 66.7%). 3DCRT has lower incidence of telangiectasia (SUCRA: 56.7%) and better cosmetic result (SUCRA: 85%). Postoperative PBI treatment using ISBT after breast-conserving surgery in patients with early-stage breast cancer may be a more valuable choice based on the treatment efficacy and is associated with fewer late side-effects. Large-scale, prospective, long-term studies are warranted to clarify the role of different PBI techniques in selected patients.","Breast cancer, Partial breast irradiation, Interstitial brachytherapy, Balloon-based brachytherapy, Intraoperative radiotherapy, Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, Network meta-analysis"
STAT1 as a tool for non-invasive monitoring of NK cell activation in cancer,"Jin Young Min, Hye Min Kim, Hyunseung Lee, Mi Young Cho, Hye Sun Park, Sang-Yeop Lee, Min Sung Park, Sang Keun Ha, Donghwan Kim, Hye Gwang Jeong, Tae-Don Kim, Kwan Soo Hong, Eun Hee Han",2024-09-30,"Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in immunotherapy for cancer due to their natural ability to target and destroy cancer cells. However, current methods to visualize NK cells’ activity against tumors in live organisms are limited. We introduce an imaging method that non-invasively tracks NK cell activation by cancer cells through the STAT1 protein. To achieve this, we modified NK cells to include a specific genetic sequence that binds to STAT1 when activated. These engineered NK cells (GAS-NK) demonstrate their functionality through various biological tests and analysis. Observations of changes in cancer environments and patient-derived cancer organoid models further confirm the effectiveness of this approach. Our method provides a way to monitor NK cell activity, which could improve the prediction and effectiveness of NK cell-based cancer therapies, contributing to advances in cancer treatment.",
Mi-2β promotes immune evasion in melanoma by activating EZH2 methylation,"Cang Li, Zhengyu Wang, Licheng Yao, Xingyu Lin, Yongping Jian, Yujia Li, Jie Zhang, Jingwei Shao, Phuc D. Tran, James R. Hagman, Meng Cao, Yusheng Cong, Hong-yu Li, Colin R. Goding, Zhi-Xiang Xu, Xuebin Liao, Xiao Miao, Rutao Cui",2024-03-09,"Recent development of new immune checkpoint inhibitors has been particularly successfully in cancer treatment, but still the majority patients fail to benefit. Converting resistant tumors to immunotherapy sensitive will provide a significant improvement in patient outcome. Here we identify Mi-2β as a key melanoma-intrinsic effector regulating the adaptive anti-tumor immune response. Studies in genetically engineered mouse melanoma models indicate that loss of Mi-2β rescues the immune response to immunotherapy in vivo. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq analysis shows that Mi-2β controls the accessibility of IFN-γ-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mi-2β binds to EZH2 and promotes K510 methylation of EZH2, subsequently activating the trimethylation of H3K27 to inhibit the transcription of ISGs. Finally, we develop an Mi-2β-targeted inhibitor, Z36-MP5, which reduces Mi-2β ATPase activity and reactivates ISG transcription. Consequently, Z36-MP5 induces a response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in otherwise resistant melanoma models. Our work provides a potential therapeutic strategy to convert immunotherapy resistant melanomas to sensitive ones.",
Reciprocal inhibition between TP63 and STAT1 regulates anti-tumor immune response through interferon-γ signaling in squamous cancer,"Yuan Jiang, Yueyuan Zheng, Yuan-Wei Zhang, Shuai Kong, Jinxiu Dong, Fei Wang, Benjamin Ziman, Sigal Gery, Jia-Jie Hao, Dan Zhou, Jianian Zhou, Allen S.

Phillip Koeffler, De-Chen Lin, Yan-Yi Jiang",2024-03-20,"Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are common and aggressive malignancies. Immune check point blockade (ICB) therapy using PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has been approved in several types of advanced SCCs. However, low response rate and treatment resistance are common. Improving the efficacy of ICB therapy requires better understanding of the mechanism of immune evasion. Here, we identify that the SCC-master transcription factor TP63 suppresses interferon-γ (IFNγ) signaling. TP63 inhibition leads to increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and heighten tumor killing in in vivo syngeneic mouse model and ex vivo co-culture system, respectively. Moreover, expression of TP63 is negatively correlated with CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation in patients with SCC. Silencing of TP63 enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-1 blockade by promoting CD8+ T cell infiltration and functionality. Mechanistically, TP63 and STAT1 mutually suppress each other to regulate the IFNγ signaling by co-occupying and co-regulating their own promoters and enhancers. Together, our findings elucidate a tumor-extrinsic function of TP63 in promoting immune evasion of SCC cells. Over-expression of TP63 may serve as a biomarker predicting the outcome of SCC patients treated with ICB therapy, and targeting TP63/STAT/IFNγ axis may enhance the efficacy of ICB therapy for this deadly cancer.",

The scarcity of NPC genomic data hinders the understanding of NPC biology, disease progression and rational therapy design. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 111 micro-dissected EBV-positive NPCs, with 15 cases subjected to further whole-genome sequencing (WGS), to determine its mutational landscape. We identified enrichment for genomic aberrations of multiple negative regulators of the NF-κB pathway, including CYLD, TRAF3, NFKBIA and NLRC5, in a total of 41% of cases. Functional analysis confirmed inactivating CYLD mutations as drivers for NPC cell growth. The EBV oncoprotein latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) functions to constitutively activate NF-κB signalling, and we observed mutual exclusivity among tumours with somatic NF-κB pathway aberrations and LMP1-overexpression, suggesting that NF-κB activation is selected for by both somatic and viral events during NPC pathogenesis.",
Activation of GPR81 by lactate drives tumour-induced cachexia,"Xidan Liu, Shijin Li, Qionghua Cui, Bujing Guo, Wanqiu Ding, Jie Liu, Li Quan, Xiaochuan Li, Peng Xie, Li Jin, Ye Sheng, Wenxin Chen, Kai Wang, Fanxin Zeng, Yifu Qiu, Changlu Liu, Yan Zhang, Fengxiang Lv, Xinli Hu, Rui-Ping Xiao",2024-03-18,"Cachexia affects 50–80% of patients with cancer and accounts for 20% of cancer-related death, but the underlying mechanism driving cachexia remains elusive. Here we show that circulating lactate levels positively correlate with the degree of body weight loss in male and female patients suffering from cancer cachexia, as well as in clinically relevant mouse models. Lactate infusion per se is sufficient to trigger a cachectic phenotype in tumour-free mice in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adipose-specific G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR)81 ablation, similarly to global GPR81 deficiency, ameliorates lactate-induced or tumour-induced adipose and muscle wasting in male mice, revealing adipose GPR81 as the major mediator of the catabolic effects of lactate. Mechanistically, lactate/GPR81-induced cachexia occurs independently of the well-established protein kinase A catabolic pathway, but it is mediated by a signalling cascade sequentially activating Gi–Gβγ–RhoA/ROCK1–p38. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting GPR81 for the treatment of this life-threatening complication of cancer.",
Mutant U2AF1-expressing cells are sensitive to pharmacological modulation of the spliceosome,"Cara Lunn Shirai, Brian S. White, Manorama Tripathi, Roberto Tapia, James N.

Walter",2017-01-09,"Somatic mutations in spliceosome genes are detectable in ∼50% of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). We hypothesize that cells harbouring spliceosome gene mutations have increased sensitivity to pharmacological perturbation of the spliceosome. We focus on mutant U2AF1 and utilize sudemycin compounds that modulate pre-mRNA splicing. We find that haematopoietic cells expressing mutant U2AF1(S34F), including primary patient cells, have an increased sensitivity to in vitro sudemycin treatment relative to controls. In vivo sudemycin treatment of U2AF1(S34F) transgenic mice alters splicing and reverts haematopoietic progenitor cell expansion induced by mutant U2AF1 expression. The splicing effects of sudemycin and U2AF1(S34F) can be cumulative in cells exposed to both perturbations—drug and mutation—compared with cells exposed to either alone. These cumulative effects may result in downstream phenotypic consequences in sudemycin-treated mutant cells. Taken together, these data suggest a potential for treating haematological cancers harbouring U2AF1 mutations with pre-mRNA splicing modulators like sudemycins.",

Gray, Leandro Cerchietti",2017-01-30,"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) are aggressive diseases with poor response to chemotherapy and dismal survival. Identification of effective strategies to target PTCL biology represents an urgent need. Here we report that PTCL are sensitive to transcription-targeting drugs, and, in particular, to THZ1, a covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7). The STAT-signalling pathway is highly vulnerable to THZ1 even in PTCL cells that carry the activating STAT3 mutation Y640F. In mutant cells, CDK7 inhibition decreases STAT3 chromatin binding and expression of highly transcribed target genes like MYC, PIM1, MCL1, CD30, IL2RA, CDC25A and IL4R. In surviving cells, THZ1 decreases the expression of STAT-regulated anti-apoptotic BH3 family members MCL1 and BCL-XL sensitizing PTCL cells to BH3 mimetic drugs. Accordingly, the combination of THZ1 and the BH3 mimetic obatoclax improves lymphoma growth control in a primary PTCL ex vivo culture and in two STAT3-mutant PTCL xenografts, delineating a potential targeted agent-based therapeutic option for these patients.",
Artificial intelligence-enabled prediction of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity from baseline electrocardiograms,"Ryuichiro Yagi, Shinichi Goto, Yukihiro Himeno, Yoshinori Katsumata, Masahiro Hashimoto, Calum A.

Despite guideline recommendations, only half of the patients undergo surveillance echocardiograms. An AI model detecting reduced left ventricular ejection fraction from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) (AI-EF model) suggests ECG features reflect left ventricular pathophysiology. We hypothesized that AI could predict CTRCD from baseline ECG, leveraging the AI-EF model’s insights, and developed the AI-CTRCD model using transfer learning on the AI-EF model. In 1011 anthracycline-treated patients, 8.7% experienced CTRCD. High AI-CTRCD scores indicated elevated CTRCD risk (hazard ratio (HR), 2.66; 95% CI 1.73–4.10; log-rank p < 0.001). This remained consistent after adjusting for risk factors (adjusted HR, 2.57; 95% CI 1.62–4.10; p < 0.001). AI-CTRCD score enhanced prediction beyond known factors (time-dependent AUC for 2 years: 0.78 with AI-CTRCD score vs. 0.74 without; p = 0.005).

Here we report long-term clinical outcomes of a randomized multicenter phase II clinical trial (NCT00118274), where patients with high-risk melanoma received a multipeptide vaccine targeting CD8+ T cells (12MP) and were randomized to receive either of two vaccines for CD4+ (helper) T cells: 6MHP (6 melanoma-specific helper peptides), or tet (a nonspecific helper peptide from tetanus toxoid). Cyclophosphamide (Cy) pre-treatment was also assessed. Primary outcomes for T cell responses to 12MP, 6MHP, and tet were previously reported, suggesting immunogenicity of both vaccines but that CD8 T cell responses to 12MP were lower when tet was replaced with 6MHP. Here, in post-hoc analyses, we report durable prolongation of overall survival by adding 6MHP instead of tet. That benefit was experienced only by male patients. A favorable interaction of 6MHP and Cy is also suggested. Multivariable Cox regression analysis of the intent-to-treat population identify vaccine arm (12MP + 6MHP+Cy) and patient sex (male) as the two significant predictors of enhanced survival. These findings support the value of adding cognate T cell help to cancer vaccines and also suggest a need to assess the impact of patient sex on immune therapy outcomes.",

Alterations in gene expression affected the composition of cell types in the generated synthetic image tiles, which accurately preserved the distribution of cell types and maintained the cell fraction observed in bulk RNA-sequencing data, as we show for lung adenocarcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma.

Targeting ATR in patients with cancer,"Natalie Y. L. Ngoi, Patrick G. Pilié, Daniel J. McGrail, Michal Zimmermann, Katharina Schlacher, Timothy A. Yap",2024-02-20,"Pharmacological inhibition of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related protein serine/threonine kinase (ATR; also known as FRAP-related protein (FRP1)) has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer treatment that exploits synthetic lethal interactions with proteins involved in DNA damage repair, overcomes resistance to other therapies and enhances antitumour immunity. Multiple novel, potent ATR inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials using biomarker-directed approaches and involving patients across a broad range of solid cancer types; some of these inhibitors have now entered phase III trials. Further insight into the complex interactions of ATR with other DNA replication stress response pathway components and with the immune system is necessary in order to optimally harness the potential of ATR inhibitors in the clinic and achieve hypomorphic targeting of the various ATR functions. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of the diverse range of predictive biomarkers of response to ATR inhibitors and of the intraclass differences between these agents could help to refine trial design and patient selection strategies. Key challenges that remain in the clinical development of ATR inhibitors include the optimization of their therapeutic index and the development of rational combinations with these agents. In this Review, we detail the molecular mechanisms regulated by ATR and their clinical relevance, and discuss the challenges that must be addressed to extend the benefit of ATR inhibitors to a broad population of patients with cancer.",
"Epidemiology of HPV-associated cancers past, present and future: towards prevention and elimination","Talía Malagón, Eduardo L. Franco, Romina Tejada, Salvatore Vaccarella",2024-05-17,"Cervical cancer is the first cancer deemed amenable to elimination through prevention, and thus lessons from the epidemiology and prevention of this cancer type can provide information on strategies to manage other cancers. Infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV) causes virtually all cervical cancers, and an important proportion of oropharyngeal, anal and genital cancers. Whereas 20th century prevention efforts were dominated by cytology-based screening, the present and future of HPV-associated cancer prevention relies mostly on HPV vaccination and molecular screening tests. In this Review, we provide an overview of the epidemiology of HPV-associated cancers, their disease burden, how past and contemporary preventive interventions have shaped their incidence and mortality, and the potential for elimination. We particularly focus on the cofactors that could have the greatest effect on prevention efforts, such as parity and human immunodeficiency virus infection, as well as on social determinants of health. Given that the incidence of and mortality from HPV-associated cancers remain strongly associated with the socioeconomic status of individuals and the human development index of countries, elimination efforts are unlikely to succeed unless prevention efforts focus on health equity, with a commitment to both primary and secondary prevention.",
Comparative overall survival of CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy in advanced breast cancer,"Coralea Kappel, Mitchell J. Elliott, Vikaash Kumar, Michelle B. Nadler, Alexandra Desnoyers, Eitan Amir",2024-02-07,"Individual trials of abemaciclib, palbociclib, and ribociclib show a similar impact on progression-free survival yet differing statistical significance for overall survival (OS). A robust comparative evaluation of OS, safety, and tolerability of the three drugs is warranted. A systematic literature search identified phase 3 randomized clinical trials reporting OS of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) in combination with endocrine therapy in ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Trial-level data on OS and common and serious adverse events (AE) were extracted for each drug. In the absence of direct comparisons, a network meta-analysis was performed to evaluate pairwise comparative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of each of the CDK4/6i. Seven studies comprising of 4415 patients met the inclusion criteria. Median follow-up was 73.3 months (range: 48.7–97.2 months). There were no statistically significant differences in OS between any of the CDK4/6i. Compared to palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib both showed significantly higher GI toxicity (grade 1–2 vomiting OR 1.87 [95% CI 1.37–2.56] and OR 2.27 [95% CI 1.59–3.23] respectively). Compared to palbociclib, abemaciclib was associated with more grade 3–4 diarrhea OR 118.06 [95% CI 7.28–1915.32]. In contrast, palbociclib was associated with significantly more neutropenia than ribociclib and abemaciclib but significantly lower risk of grade 3–4 infections. Abemaciclib had significantly less grade 3–4 transaminitis and grade 3–4 neutropenia than ribociclib. Treatment discontinuation and death due to AE were significantly higher with abemaciclib than palbociclib and ribociclib. There is no statistically significant difference in OS between CDK4/6i despite differing statistical significance levels of individual trials. Real-world data analyses may help to identify if there is a meaningful inter-drug difference in efficacy. Significant differences between CDK4/6i are observed for safety and tolerability outcomes.",
Rethinking surgical revisions: impact of the MonarchE trial on axillary dissection in hormone-positive HER2-negative early breast cancer patients potentially eligible for abemaciclib,"Thomas Gaillard, Jeanne Piketty, Jean-Guillaume Feron, Noemie Girard, Lea Pauly, Elodie Gauroy, Lauren Darrigues, Beatriz Grandal, Jean-Yves Pierga, Anne-Sophie Hamy-Petit, Fabien Reyal, Enora Laas",2024-01-27,"IntroductionThe MonarchE trial explored the use of abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, as an adjuvant treatment in high-risk early-stage luminal-like breast cancer. The study’s inclusion criteria, especially the N2 status, may require revisiting surgical interventions, including invasive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)—a procedure that current guidelines generally do not recommend.MethodsWe conducted a single-centre, retrospective, observational cohort study on non-metastatic breast cancer patients managed from 2002 to 2011, at the Institut Curie. Data collection involved clinical and histological characteristics plus treatment follow-up.ResultsOut of 8715 treated patients, 721 met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 12% (87) were classified as N2 ( ≥ 4 positive lymph nodes), thus eligible for abemaciclib per “node criterion.” Tumour size, positive sentinel lymph nodes, and lobular histology showed a significant correlation with N2 status. Approximately 1000 ALNDs would be required to identify 120 N2 cases and prevent four recurrences.ConclusionThe MonarchE trial may significantly affect surgical practices due to the need for invasive procedures to identify high-risk patients for adjuvant abemaciclib treatment. The prospect of unnecessary morbidity demands less invasive N2 status determination methods. Surgical decisions must consider patient health and potential treatment benefits.",
Precise single column resection and reconstruction with femoral head plus total hip replacement for primary malignant peri-acetabulum tumors,"Yongkun Yang, Yuan Li, Weifeng Liu, Xiaohui Niu",2024-02-10,"To evaluate whether single acetabular column can be reserved and the effect of reconstruction with femoral head plus total hip replacement (THR) for primary malignant peri-acetabulum tumors. From 2007 to 2015, nineteen patients with primary malignant peri-acetabulum tumors were enrolled. All cases underwent single column resection with clear surgical margins. Ten of the 19 tumor’s resections were assisted by computer navigation. Femoral heads were applied to reconstruct anterior or posterior column defects; THR was used for joint reconstruction. The surgical safety, oncologic outcome and prosthesis survivorship and function were evaluated by regular follow-up. The average follow-up period was 65.9 months. Surgical margins contained wide resection in 12 cases and marginal resection in 7 cases. One patient with Ewing's sarcoma died 14 months postoperative due to lung metastasis. One case with chondrosarcoma had recurrence. One prosthesis was removed due to infection. The average MusculoSkeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) function score was 83.7%. Due to the relative small number of cases, there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate and prosthesis failure rate between the navigation group and non-navigation group. Single column resection and reconstruction with femoral head autograft plus THR is an effective, safe method with less complication rate and better functional outcome for patients with peri-acetabular tumors.",

From state-of-the-art treatments to novel therapies for advanced-stage pancreatic cancer,"Christopher Nevala-Plagemann, Manuel Hidalgo, Ignacio Garrido-Laguna",2019-11-08,"Improvements in the outcomes of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have lagged behind advances made in the treatment of many other malignancies over the past few decades. For most patients with PDAC, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. For patients with resectable disease, modified 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) is the standard-of-care adjuvant therapy, although data from several randomized trials have shown improved outcomes with neoadjuvant treatment strategies. For patients with advanced-stage or metastatic disease, comprehensive genomic profiling has revealed several potentially actionable alterations in small subsets of patients and the feasibility of implementing such strategies is beginning to be confirmed. Novel therapies targeting certain aberrations, most notably BRCA1/2 mutations, mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies or NTRK1–3 fusions, have shown considerable activity in clinical trials, and larotrectinib, entrectinib and pembrolizumab have received FDA approval for the treatment of patients with tumours harbouring NTRK fusions and MMR deficiencies, respectively, regardless of primary tumour histology. In this Review, we describe the available data on the activity of these and other agents in patients with PDAC. Our discussion is structured according to the acronym ‘PRIME’ to organize the various treatment strategies currently undergoing evaluation in clinical trials: Pathway inhibition, alteration of DNA Repair pathways, Immunotherapy, cancer Metabolism and targeting the Extracellular tumour microenvironment.",
Adipocytes disrupt the translational programme of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia to favour tumour survival and persistence,"Q. Heydt, C. Xintaropoulou, A. Clear, M. Austin, I. Pislariu, F.

McNaughton, D. Bonnet, F. Mardakheh, B. Patel",2021-09-17,"The specific niche adaptations that facilitate primary disease and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) survival after induction chemotherapy remain unclear. Here, we show that Bone Marrow (BM) adipocytes dynamically evolve during ALL pathogenesis and therapy, transitioning from cellular depletion in the primary leukaemia niche to a fully reconstituted state upon remission induction. Functionally, adipocyte niches elicit a fate switch in ALL cells towards slow-proliferation and cellular quiescence, highlighting the critical contribution of the adipocyte dynamic to disease establishment and chemotherapy resistance. Mechanistically, adipocyte niche interaction targets posttranscriptional networks and suppresses protein biosynthesis in ALL cells. Treatment with general control nonderepressible 2 inhibitor (GCN2ib) alleviates adipocyte-mediated translational repression and rescues ALL cell quiescence thereby significantly reducing the cytoprotective effect of adipocytes against chemotherapy and other extrinsic stressors. These data establish how adipocyte driven restrictions of the ALL proteome benefit ALL tumours, preventing their elimination, and suggest ways to manipulate adipocyte-mediated ALL resistance.",

Darcy, Paul A. Beavis",2021-05-28,"Adenosine is an immunosuppressive factor that limits anti-tumor immunity through the suppression of multiple immune subsets including T cells via activation of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR). Using both murine and human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, here we show that targeting A2AR with a clinically relevant CRISPR/Cas9 strategy significantly enhances their in vivo efficacy, leading to improved survival of mice. Effects evoked by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated gene deletion of A2AR are superior to shRNA mediated knockdown or pharmacological blockade of A2AR. Mechanistically, human A2AR-edited CAR T cells are significantly resistant to adenosine-mediated transcriptional changes, resulting in enhanced production of cytokines including IFNγ and TNF, and increased expression of JAK-STAT signaling pathway associated genes. A2AR deficient CAR T cells are well tolerated and do not induce overt pathologies in mice, supporting the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to target A2AR for the improvement of CAR T cell function in the clinic.",
Proteogenomic discovery of neoantigens facilitates personalized multi-antigen targeted T cell immunotherapy for brain tumors,"Samuel Rivero-Hinojosa, Melanie Grant, Aswini Panigrahi, Huizhen Zhang, Veronika Caisova, Catherine M. Bollard, Brian R. Rood",2021-11-18,"Neoantigen discovery in pediatric brain tumors is hampered by their low mutational burden and scant tissue availability. Here we develop a proteogenomic approach combining tumor DNA/RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics to identify tumor-restricted (neoantigen) peptides arising from multiple genomic aberrations to generate a highly target-specific, autologous, personalized T cell immunotherapy. Our data indicate that aberrant splice junctions are the primary source of neoantigens in medulloblastoma, a common pediatric brain tumor. Proteogenomically identified tumor-specific peptides are immunogenic and generate MHC II-based T cell responses. Moreover, polyclonal and polyfunctional T cells specific for tumor-specific peptides effectively eliminate tumor cells in vitro. Targeting tumor-specific antigens obviates the issue of central immune tolerance while potentially providing a safety margin favoring combination with other immune-activating therapies. These findings demonstrate the proteogenomic discovery of immunogenic tumor-specific peptides and lay the groundwork for personalized targeted T cell therapies for children with brain tumors.",
Genetic counseling and genetic testing for pathogenic germline mutations among high-risk patients previously diagnosed with breast cancer: a traceback approach,"Hikmat Abdel-Razeq, Faris Tamimi, Sereen Iweir, Baha Sharaf, Sarah Abdel-Razeq, Osama Salama, Sarah Edaily, Hira Bani Hani, Khansa Azzam, Haneen Abaza",2024-06-04,"Genetic counseling and testing are more accessible than ever due to reduced costs, expanding indications and public awareness. Nonetheless, many patients missed the opportunity of genetic counseling and testing due to barriers that existed at that time of their cancer diagnoses. Given the identified implications of pathogenic mutations on patients’ treatment and familial outcomes, an opportunity exists to utilize a ‘traceback’ approach to retrospectively examine their genetic makeup and provide consequent insights to their disease and treatment. In this study, we identified living patients diagnosed with breast cancer (BC) between July 2007 and January 2022 who would have been eligible for testing, but not tested. Overall, 422 patients met the eligibility criteria, 282 were reached and invited to participate, and germline testing was performed for 238, accounting for 84.4% of those invited. The median age (range) was 39.5 (24–64) years at BC diagnosis and 49 (31–75) years at the date of testing. Genetic testing revealed that 25 (10.5%) patients had pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants; mostly in BRCA2 and BRCA1. We concluded that long overdue genetic referral through a traceback approach is feasible and effective to diagnose P/LP variants in patients with history of BC who had missed the opportunity of genetic testing, with potential clinical implications for patients and their relatives.","Breast cancer, Pathogenic germline mutation, BRCA, Traceback, Genetic counseling"
TLR agonists polarize interferon responses in conjunction with dendritic cell vaccination in malignant glioma: a randomized phase II Trial,"Richard G.

Cloughesy, Linda M. Liau, Robert M. Prins",2024-05-08,"In this randomized phase II clinical trial, we evaluated the effectiveness of adding the TLR agonists, poly-ICLC or resiquimod, to autologous tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cell (ATL-DC) vaccination in patients with newly-diagnosed or recurrent WHO Grade III-IV malignant gliomas. The primary endpoints were to assess the most effective combination of vaccine and adjuvant in order to enhance the immune potency, along with safety. The combination of ATL-DC vaccination and TLR agonist was safe and found to enhance systemic immune responses, as indicated by increased interferon gene expression and changes in immune cell activation. Specifically, PD-1 expression increases on CD4+ T-cells, while CD38 and CD39 expression are reduced on CD8+ T cells, alongside an increase in monocytes. Poly-ICLC treatment amplifies the induction of interferon-induced genes in monocytes and T lymphocytes. Patients that exhibit higher interferon response gene expression demonstrate prolonged survival and delayed disease progression. These findings suggest that combining ATL-DC with poly-ICLC can induce a polarized interferon response in circulating monocytes and CD8+ T cells, which may represent an important blood biomarker for immunotherapy in this patient population.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01204684.",
FGFR inhibition blocks NF-ĸB-dependent glucose metabolism and confers metabolic vulnerabilities in cholangiocarcinoma,"Yuanli Zhen, Kai Liu, Lei Shi, Simran Shah, Qin Xu, Haley Ellis, Eranga R. Balasooriya, Johannes Kreuzer, Robert Morris, Albert S. Baldwin, Dejan Juric, Wilhelm Haas, Nabeel Bardeesy",2024-05-07,"Genomic alterations that activate Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 (FGFR2) are common in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and confer sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. However, the depth and duration of response is often limited. Here, we conduct integrative transcriptomics, metabolomics, and phosphoproteomics analysis of patient-derived models to define pathways downstream of oncogenic FGFR2 signaling that fuel ICC growth and to uncover compensatory mechanisms associated with pathway inhibition. We find that FGFR2-mediated activation of Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) maintains a highly glycolytic phenotype. Conversely, FGFR inhibition blocks glucose uptake and glycolysis while inciting adaptive changes, including switching fuel source utilization favoring fatty acid oxidation and increasing mitochondrial fusion and autophagy. Accordingly, FGFR inhibitor efficacy is potentiated by combined mitochondrial targeting, an effect enhanced in xenograft models by intermittent fasting. Thus, we show that oncogenic FGFR2 signaling drives NF-κB-dependent glycolysis in ICC and that metabolic reprogramming in response to FGFR inhibition confers new targetable vulnerabilities.",
"Impact of deep inspiration breath hold, surface-guided radiotherapy, and daily CBCT on the organs at risk in breast cancer radiotherapy","Volker Rudat, Ruping Zhao, Bin Wang, Lihua Zhang, Yanyan Shi",2024-11-13,"The goal of the study was to assess the impact of deep inspiration breath hold technique (DIBH), surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT), and daily kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT) on the dose to organs at risk (OAR) in left-sided breast cancer radiotherapy. Twenty-six consecutive left-sided breast cancer patients treated using Volumetric Intensity Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), DIBH, SGRT, and a hypofractionated regimen were retrospectively evaluated in this study. Dose parameters were extracted from dose-volume histograms (DVH). The Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test was used to test dose parameters obtained in free breathing (FB) and DIBH for statistical significance. Multivariable analysis of variance (ANOVA) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis were used to identify parameters and cut-off points associated with the reduction of the mean heart dose (MHD) by DIBH. Based on published models, the risk of cardiac and lung toxicity (pneumonitis) using SGRT or daily kV-CBCT was estimated and compared. DIBH substantially reduced the MHD (median, 43.6%; range, 4.2% to 75.1%; P < 0.00001). The risk of cardiac toxicity using SGRT increased by 1%, compared to 3.6% to 20.5% using daily kV-CBCT. No significant difference in the risk of radiation-induced pneumonitis using SGRT versus daily kV-CBCT was detected. The ANOVA revealed the relative increase of the left lung volume by DIBH as the only significant impact factor for the MHD. The ROC analysis of this parameter showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95%CI, 0.71 to 0.98; P < 0.0001). DIBH can substantially reduce the MHD in left-sided breast cancer patients treated with modern radiotherapy techniques and hypofractionation. Patient setup using SGRT compared to daily kV-CBCT may be the preferred option for many patients. In our patient cohort, the relative reduction of the left lung volume by DIBH can be used as a predictor to select patients who benefit from DIBH.","Breast cancer, Radiotherapy, Surface guided radiotherapy, Deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH), Organs at risk"
Clinical and NGS predictors of response to regorafenib in recurrent glioblastoma,"Silvia Chiesa, Antonella Mangraviti, Maurizio Martini, Tonia Cenci, Ciro Mazzarella, Simona Gaudino, Serena Bracci, Antonella Martino, Giuseppe M.

The objective of this study was to identify molecular predictive factors for response to regorafenib using a clinically available platform. We analyzed a prospective cohort of 30 patients harboring recurrent glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, and treated with regorafenib. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis was performed on DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues using a clinically available platform. Moreover, MGMT methylation and EGFRvIII expression analyses were performed. Six-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 30% and median overall survival (OS) was 7.5 months, in line with literature data. NGS analysis revealed a mutation in the EGFR pathway in 18% of cases and a mutation in the mitogen-activated protein-kinase (MAPK) pathway in 18% of cases. In the remaining cases, no mutations were detected. Patients carrying MAPK pathway mutation had a poor response to regorafenib treatment, with a significantly shorter PFS and a nonsignificantly shorter OS compared to EGFR-mutated patients (for PFS, 2.5 vs 4.5 months, p = 0.0061; for OS, 7 vs 9 months, p = 0.1076). Multivariate analysis confirmed that MAPK pathway mutations independently predicted a shorter PFS after regorafenib treatment (p = 0.0188). The negative prognostic role of MAPK pathway alteration was reinforced when we combined EGFR-mutated with EGFRvIII-positive cases. Recurrent glioblastoma tumors with an alteration in MAPK pathway could belong to the mesenchymal subtype and respond poorly to regorafenib treatment, while EGFR-altered cases have a better response to regorafenib. We thus provide a molecular selection criterion easy to implement in the clinical practice.",
Aspirin prevents colorectal cancer by regulating the abundance of Enterococcus cecorum and TIGIT+Treg cells,"Xiaojuan Yang, Yajuan Yan, Fengkui Wang, Jinhua Tian, Qian Cao, Miao Liu, Bin Ma, Chunxia Su, Xiangguo Duan",2024-06-12,"Although aspirin can reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC), there is still uncertainty about its significance as a treatment for CRC, and the mechanism of aspirin in CRC is not well understood. In this study, we used aspirin to prevent AOM/DSS-induced CRC in mice, and the anti-CRC efficacy of aspirin was assessed using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and by determining the mouse survival rate and tumour size. 16S rDNA sequencing, flow cytometry (FCM), and Western blotting were also conducted to investigate the changes in the gut microbiota, tumour immune microenvironment, and apoptotic proteins, respectively. The results demonstrated that aspirin significantly exerted anti-CRC effects in mice. According to 16S rDNA sequencing, aspirin regulated the composition of the gut microbiota and dramatically reduced the abundance of Enterococcus cecorum. FCM demonstrated that there were more CD155 tumour cells and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells showed increased TIGIT levels. Moreover, increased TIGIT expression on Treg cells is associated with reduced Treg cell functionality. Importantly, the inhibition of Treg cells is accompanied by the promotion of CD19 + GL-7 + B cells, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + CCR4 + Th2 cells, and CD4 + CCR6 + Th17 cells. Overall, aspirin prevents colorectal cancer by regulating the abundance of Enterococcus cecorum and TIGIT + Treg cells.",
Pathomic and bioinformatics analysis of clinical-pathological and genomic factors for pancreatic cancer prognosis,"Yang Li, Lujuan Pan, Joseph Mugaanyi, Hua Li, Gehui Li, Jing Huang, Lei Dai",2024-11-13,"Pancreatic cancer exhibits a high degree of malignancy with a poor prognosis, lacking effective prognostic targets. Utilizing histopathological methodologies, this study endeavors to predict the expression of pathological features in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and investigate their underlying molecular mechanisms. Pathological images, transcriptomic, and clinical data from TCGA-PAAD were collected for survival analysis. Image segmentation using unsupervised machine learning was employed to extract features, perform clustering, and establish models. The prognostic value of pathological features and associated clinical risk factors were evaluated; the correlation between pathological features and molecular mechanisms, gene mutations, and immune infiltration was analyzed. By clustering 45 effective pathological features, we divided PAAD patients into two groups: cluster 1 and cluster 2. Significant associations with poor prognosis were found for cluster 2 in both the training group (n = 113) and validation group (n = 75) (p = 0.006), with pathological stages II-IV identified as potential synergistic risk factors (HR = 2.421, 95% CI = 1.263–4.639, p = 0.008). Subsequently, through multi-omics correlation analysis, we further revealed a close association between cluster 2 and the oxidative phosphorylation mechanism. Within the cluster 2 group, 28 oxidative phosphorylation genes exhibited reduced expression, CDKN2A gene mutations were upregulated, and there was significant downregulation of Tregs infiltration and related immune gene expression. The pathomic model constructed using machine learning serves as a valuable prognostic target for PAAD. The histopathological features cluster 2 are closely associated with the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation levels and Tregs immune infiltration.","Pancreatic Cancer, Pathomics, Prognosis, Machine learning, Oxidative phosphorylation"
The effect of thyroid cancer on the survival of patients with digestive system tumors using SEER database,"Siqin Zuo, Yongning Zhou, Ya Zheng, Rui Ji",2024-11-13,"The number of cancer survivors worldwide is increasing every year, making secondary primary cancers (SPC) is a growing health threat. Studies have been conducted to investigate the risk of occurrence between digestive system tumors (DST) and thyroid cancer (TC). However, existing studies have tended to focus more on the risk of developing SPC and less on the impact of SPC on the survival of cancer survivors. In this study, using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we aimed to explore the impact of TC on the survival of patients with DST by data between 2000 and 2018. The study employed the standardized incidence ratio to assess the relative risk of SPC, propensity score matching was conducted to mitigate confounding effects, Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional risk model and competitive risk model were used to analyze the factors affecting the overall survival and cancer-specific survival. We furthermore explored the influence of pathological types and radiotherapy of TC on the survival of DST patients. 518,901 patients with DST only, 801 patients with TC occurring earlier than DST (TC-1st), and 744 patients with DST occurring earlier than TC (DST-1st) were included. The total incidence rate of small intestine cancer after TC was higher than that of the general population, and the incidence of TC after DST was higher than in the general population. DST patients with a history of TC had better overall survival and lower cancer-specific mortality and this difference was particularly significant in patients with DST-1st. In addition, radiotherapy for TC had no effect on cancer-specific mortality in patients with DST.","Digestive system tumors, Thyroid cancer, Second primary cancer, Survival analysis, Competitive risk model"
The UF-5000 Atyp.C parameter is an independent risk factor for bladder cancer,"Tong Zhang, Jianhong Zhu, Zhaoxing Li, Ya Zhao, Yan Li, Jing Li, Qian He, Yan Geng, Wei Lu, Lei Zhang, Zhenzhen Li",2024-06-03,"Bladder carcinoma (BC) accounts for > 90% of all urothelial cancers. Pathological diagnosis through cytoscopic biopsy is the gold standard, whereas non-invasive diagnostic tools remain lacking. The “Atyp.C” parameter of the Sysmex UF-5000 urine particle analyzer represents the ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm and can be employed to detect urinary atypical cells. The present study examined the association between urinary Atyp.C values and BC risk. This two-center, retrospective case–control study identified clinical primary or newly recurrent BC (study period, 2022–2023; n = 473) cases together with controls with urinary tract infection randomly matched by age and sex (1:1). Urinary sediment differences were compared using non-parametric tests. The correlations between urinary Atyp.C levels and BC grade or infiltration were analyzed using Spearman’s rank correlation. The BC risk factor odds ratio of Atyp.C was calculated using conditional logistic regression, and potential confounder effects were adjusted using stepwise logistic regression (LR). Primary risk factors were identified by stratified analysis according to pathological histological diagnosis. The mean value of urinary Atyp.C in BC cases (1.30 ± 3.12) was 8.7 times higher than that in the controls (0.15 ± 0.68; P < 0.001). Urinary Atyp.C values were positively correlated with BC pathological grade and invasion (r = 0.360, P < 0.001; r = 0.367, P < 0.001). Urinary Atyp.C was an independent risk factor for BC and closely related with BC pathological grade and invasion. Elevated urinary Atyp.C values was an independent risk factor for BC. Our findings support the use of Atyp.C as a marker that will potentially aid in the early diagnosis and long-term surveillance of new and recurrent BC cases.","Bladder cancer, Atyp.C, Conditional logistic regression, Risk factor"

Herein, we present an ad hoc analysis of the NEOSTAR trial (NCT03158129) where we observed a phenomenon we refer to as “nodal immune flare” (NIF) in which patients treated with neoadjuvant ICIs demonstrate radiologically abnormal nodes post-therapy that upon pathological evaluation are devoid of cancer and demonstrate de novo non-caseating granulomas. Abnormal lymph nodes are analyzed by computed tomography and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography to evaluate the size and the maximum standard uptake value post- and pre-therapy in NEOSTAR and an independent neoadjuvant chemotherapy cohort. NIF occurs in 16% (7/44) of patients treated with ICIs but in 0% (0/28) of patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. NIF is associated with an inflamed nodal immune microenvironment and with fecal abundance of genera belonging to the family Coriobacteriaceae of phylum Actinobacteria, but not with tumor responses or treatment-related toxicity. Our findings suggest that this apparent radiological cancer progression in lymph nodes may occur due to an inflammatory response after neoadjuvant immunotherapy, and such cases should be evaluated by pathological examination to distinguish NIF from true nodal progression and to ensure appropriate clinical treatment planning.",
Hemostatic effect of 3D-printed hip fixators in children with retinoblastoma after intra-arterial chemotherapy: a non-randomized controlled trial,"Changjuan Zeng, Yifan Wu, Yanan He, Na Du, Shanshan Xiong, Fen Gu, Lili Hou",2024-11-11,"This study aimed to investigate the benefits of using three-dimensional (3D)-printed hip joint fixators after intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) by inguinal femoral artery puncture in children with retinoblastoma. Overall, 79 cases of retinoblastoma who had undergone IAC through the femoral artery were selected and divided into an observation group of 50 cases and an intervention group of 29 cases according to the hemostasis method employed. The patients in the observation group were treated with sandbags for hemostasis, while those in the intervention group were given 3D-printed hip joint fixators to help immobilize the hips and sandbags. We used the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability scale (FLACC), the Wong–Baker Facial Expression Pain Scale, and self-made questionnaires to evaluate demographics, clinical characteristics, pain, complications, satisfaction, and other indicators of the two groups. There were no significant differences in general data, such as age, gender, height, weight, manual compression time, diseased eye, tumor stage, platelet count, puncture times, pain distribution, and total score, between the groups. There was a positive correlation between FLACC pain and the total Wong–Baker pain score (r = 0.599, p < 0.001). During the 2 h of sandbag compression, sandbags were dislodged in the observation group as many as ten times, which was significantly higher than that in the intervention group (up to four times; p < 0.001). This was correlated with a very high score of satisfaction (92.34 ± 19.96 out of 100). The 3D-printed hip fixator is easy to operate, has a low incidence of complications, and saves time and effort. It effectively reduces the incidence of sandbags falling off after IAC in children with retinoblastoma and does not increase the patient’s pain. It is a method that could improve hemostasis in young children undergoing IAC by inguinal femoral artery.",
Integrated multiomics analysis identified comprehensive crosstalk between diverse programmed cell death patterns and novel molecular subtypes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Li Chen, Yuanbo Hu, Yu Li, Bingyu Zhang, Jiale Wang, Mengmeng Deng, Jinlian Zhang, Wenyao Zhu, Hao Gu, Lingyu Zhang",2024-11-11,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with increasing global prevalence and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in the human population. Developing robust clinical prediction models and prognostic stratification strategies is crucial for developing individualized treatment plans. A range of novel forms of programmed cell death (PCD) plays a role in the pathological progression and advancement of HCC, and in-depth study of PCD is expected to further improve the prognosis of HCC patients. Sixteen patterns (apoptosis, autophagy, anoikis, lysosome-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell death, necroptosis, ferroptosis, netosis, pyroptosis, disulfidptosis, entotic cell death, cuproptosis, parthanatos, netotic cell death, alkaliptosis, and oxeiptosis) related to PCD were collected from the literatures and used for subsequent analysis. Supervised (Elastic net, Random Forest, XgBoost, and Boruta) and unsupervised (Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, NMF) clustering algorithms were applied to develop and validate a novel classifier for the individualized management of HCC patients at the transcriptomic, proteomic and single-cell levels. Multiple machine learning algorithms developed a programmed cell death index (PCDI) comprising five robust signatures (FTL, G6PD, SLC2A1, HTRA2, and DLAT) in four independent HCC cohorts, and a higher PCDI was predictive of higher pathological grades and worse prognoses. Furthermore, a higher PCDI was found to be correlated with the presence of a repressive tumor immune microenvironment (TME), as determined through an integrated examination of bulk and single-cell transcriptome data. In addition, patients with TP53 mutation had higher PCDI in comparison with TP53 WT patients. Three HCC subtypes were identified through unsupervised clustering (NMF), exhibiting distinct prognoses and significant biological processes, among the three subtypes, PCDcluster 3 was of particular interest as it contained a large proportion of patients with high risk and low metabolic activity. Construction and evaluation of the Nomogram model was drawn based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis, and highlighted the robustness of the Nomogram model in other independent HCC cohorts. Finally, to explore the prognostic value, we also validated the frequent upregulation of DLAT in a real-world cohort of human HCC specimens by qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Together, our work herein comprehensively emphasized PCD-related patterns and key regulators, such as DLAT, contributed to the evolution and prognosis of tumor foci in HCC patients, and strengthened our understanding of PCD characteristics and promoted more effective risk stratification strategies.","Hepatocellular carcinoma, Molecular subtype, Programmed cell death, Machine learning model, Integrated multi-omics analysis"
"Comparison of drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization combined with apatinib versus drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized, prospective, multicenter phase III trial","Xuhua Duan, Hao Li, Donglin Kuang, Pengfei Chen, Mengfan Zhang, Tengfei Li, Dechao Jiao, Yanliang Li, Xiang He, Cheng Xing, Haibo Wang, Yaoxian Liu, Limin Xie, Shixi Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Peixin Zhu, Yongchuang Chang, Jichen Xie, Jianzhuang Ren, Xinwei Han",2024-11-13,"This randomized, prospective, multicenter (12 centers in China) phase III trial (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry #ChiCTR2000041170) compared drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) combined with apatinib and DEB-TACE monotherapy for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS), mRECIST-based objective response rates (ORR) and disease control rates (DCR), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were secondary endpoints. Totally 243 cases were randomized, with 122 and 121 in the DEB-TACE + apatinib and DEB-TACE groups, respectively. Cases administered DEB-TACE + apatinib displayed markedly improved median PFS (7.1 months [95%CI 6.6–8.3] vs. 5.2 months [95%CI 5.0–5.9]) and OS (23.3 months [95%CI 20.7–29.6] vs. 18.9 months [95%CI 17.9–20.1] compared with those treated with DEB-TACE (both p < 0.001). Additionally, patients administered DEB-TACE + apatinib had elevated ORR (56.6% vs. 38.8%) and DCR (89.3% vs. 80.2%) versus the DEB-TACE group (both p < 0.001). Majority of TRAEs were mild and manageable. Regarding DEB-TACE-related TRAEs, the rates of hepatic artery thinning and spasms were elevated during the second DEB-TACE in cases administered DEB-TACE + apatinib vs. DEB-TACE. The commonest apatinib-related TRAEs in the DEB-TACE + apatinib group included hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, fatigue, and diarrhea. In conclusion, DEB-TACE plus apatinib demonstrates superior PFS versus DEB-TACE monotherapy in uHCC cases, maintaining a favorable safety profile with similar occurrences of AEs.",
TIPE2 inhibits melanoma progression through MEK/ERK signaling,"Xin Gao, Yan Li, Congcong Wang, Guowei Zhao",2024-11-12,"Recent studies have uncovered that TIPE2 is involved in the development of cancer. However, less research has been conducted on the role of TIPE2 in melanoma. Our study aims to elucidate the mechanism of action of TIPE2 in the development of melanoma. We examined TIPE2 expression in paracarcinoma tissue and melanoma tissues and found that TIPE2 expression was downregulated in melanoma tissue compared with paracarcinoma tissue. Overexpression of TIPE2 significantly inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro and even inhibited tumor formation in vivo. The CCK8 assay results indicated that TIPE2 overexpression suppressed the proliferation of melanoma cells. The colony-forming ability and wound healing ability of TIPE2-overexpressing melanoma cells were significantly reduced compared with those of control cells. Moreover, immunohistochemistry experiments using a nude mouse tumor model showed consistent results. TIPE2 inhibited the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. In summary, TIPE2 suppresses the proliferation and migration of melanoma cells by affecting proliferation-related factors and possibly by regulating the MEK/ERK pathway. TIPE2 could be used to inhibit melanoma growth and is a potential drug target for future drug development.","Melanoma, TIPE2, Proliferation, Migration, ERK"

Recently, structure–activity relationship analysis reported by our group suggested that selective cytotoxicity of fascaplysin derivatives towards tumor cells negatively correlates with their ability to intercalate into DNA. To validate this hypothesis, we synthesized 6- and 7-tert-butylfascaplysins which reveal mitigated DNA-intercalating properties. These derivatives were found to be strongly cytotoxic to drug-resistant human prostate cancer cells, albeit did not demonstrate improved selectivity towards cancer cells when compared to fascaplysin. At the same time, kinome analysis suggested an activation of CHK1/ATR axis in cancer cells shortly after the drug exposure. Further experiments revealed induction of replication stress that is eventually converted to the toxic DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death. Our observations highlight new DNA-targeting effect of some fascaplysin derivatives and indicate more complex structure–activity relationships within the fascaplysin family, suggesting that cytotoxicity and selectivity of these alkaloids are influenced by multiple factors. Furthermore, combination with clinically-approved inhibitors of ATR/CHK1 as well as testing in tumors particularly sensitive to the DNA damage should be considered in further studies.","Fascaplysin, Marine compound, Synthesis, Prostate cancer, DNA targeting, Natural products, Synergism"
An immune-related eleven-RNA signature-drived risk score model for prognosis of osteosarcoma metastasis,"Jia-Song Teng, Yang Wang",2024-06-11,"This study aimed to determine an immune-related RNA signature as a prognostic marker, in this study, we developed a risk score model for predicting the prognosis of osteosarcoma metastasis. We first downloaded the clinical information and expression data of osteosarcoma samples from the UCSC Xena and GEO databases, of which the former was the training set and the latter was the validation set. Immune infiltration was assessed using the ssGSEA and ESTIMATE algorithms, and the osteosarcoma samples were divided into the Immunity_L and Immunity_H groups. Then, eleven RNAs were identified as the optimal prognostic RNA signatures using LASSO Cox regression analysis for establishing a risk score (RS) model. Kaplan–Meier approach indicated the high-risk group exhibited a shorter survival. Furthermore, we analyzed the tumor metastasis, age, and RS model status were determined to be independent clinical prognostic factors using Cox regression analysis. Decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the prognostic factor + RS model had the best net benefit. Finally, nine tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) showed significant differences in abundance between high- and low-risk groups via CIBERSORT deconvolution algorithm. In conclusion, the immune-related eleven-RNA signature be could served as a potential prognostic biomarker for osteosarcoma metastasis.","Osteosarcoma, Metastasis, Risk score model, Prognosis"

Carlson, Kaisa Lehti",2021-06-23,"Due to its dynamic nature, the evolution of cancer cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) crosstalk, critically affecting metastasis and treatment resistance, remains elusive. Our results show that platinum-chemotherapy itself enhances resistance by progressively changing the cancer cell-intrinsic adhesion signaling and cell-surrounding ECM. Examining ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) transcriptome and histology, we describe the fibrotic ECM heterogeneity at primary tumors and distinct metastatic sites, prior and after chemotherapy. Using cell models from systematic ECM screen to collagen-based 2D and 3D cultures, we demonstrate that both specific ECM substrates and stiffness increase resistance to platinum-mediated, apoptosis-inducing DNA damage via FAK and β1 integrin-pMLC-YAP signaling. Among such substrates around metastatic HGSCs, COL6 was upregulated by chemotherapy and enhanced the resistance of relapse, but not treatment-naïve, HGSC organoids. These results identify matrix adhesion as an adaptive response, driving HGSC aggressiveness via co-evolving ECM composition and sensing, suggesting stromal and tumor strategies for ECM pathway targeting.",

Here, using multi-region whole exome/T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry, we reveal a rather homogeneous mutational landscape but extremely cold and heterogeneous TCR repertoire in limited-stage SCLC tumors (LS-SCLCs). Compared to localized non-small cell lung cancers, LS-SCLCs have similar predicted neoantigen burden and genomic ITH, but significantly colder and more heterogeneous TCR repertoire associated with higher chromosomal copy number aberration (CNA) burden. Furthermore, copy number loss of IFN-γ pathway genes is frequently observed and positively correlates with CNA burden. Higher mutational burden, higher T cell infiltration and positive PD-L1 expression are associated with longer overall survival (OS), while higher CNA burden is associated with shorter OS in patients with LS-SCLC.",
"The high costs of anticancer therapies in the USA: challenges, opportunities and progress","Shelley A. Jazowski, Rahul K. Nayak, Stacie B. Dusetzina",2024-10-04,"The USA spent $99 billion on orally administered and clinician-administered anticancer therapies (excluding supportive care) in 2023 and spending is projected to increase to $180 billion by 2028. This increased spending on anticancer therapies largely reflects the high launch prices of novel therapeutics and increases in the prices of existing products, even in the absence of new evidence of clinical benefit or changes in use. Consequently, high prices have impeded Americans’ access to and affordability of necessary anticancer therapies and thus increased their risk of cost-related non-adherence, cancer recurrence and mortality. To address the rising prices and concerns regarding Americans’ spending on anticancer therapies, state and federal governments have, over the past decade, enacted legislation that caps out-of-pocket spending, expands subsidies and requires drug price negotiations. In this Perspective, we summarize US policies aimed to lower the costs of anticancer therapies, discuss the implications of such reforms and propose additional solutions needed to reduce costs and increase value.",
An RFC4/Notch1 signaling feedback loop promotes NSCLC metastasis and stemness,"Lei Liu, Tianyu Tao, Shihua Liu, Xia Yang, Xuwei Chen, Jiaer Liang, Ruohui Hong, Wenting Wang, Yi Yang, Xiaoyi Li, Youhong Zhang, Quanfeng Li, Shujun Liang, Haocheng Yu, Yun Wu, Xinyu Guo, Yan Lai, Xiaofan Ding, Hongyu Guan, Jueheng Wu, Xun Zhu, Jie Yuan, Jun Li, Shicheng Su, Mengfeng Li, Xiuyu Cai, Junchao Cai, Han Tian",2021-05-11,"Notch signaling represents a key mechanism mediating cancer metastasis and stemness. To understand how Notch signaling is overactivated to couple tumor metastasis and self-renewal in NSCLC cells, we performed the current study and showed that RFC4, a DNA replication factor amplified in more than 40% of NSCLC tissues, directly binds to the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1) to competitively abrogate CDK8/FBXW7-mediated degradation of NICD1. Moreover, RFC4 is a functional transcriptional target gene of Notch1 signaling, forming a positive feedback loop between high RFC4 and NICD1 levels and sustained overactivation of Notch signaling, which not only leads to NSCLC tumorigenicity and metastasis but also confers NSCLC cell resistance to treatment with the clinically tested drug DAPT against NICD1 synthesis. Furthermore, together with our study, analysis of two public datasets involving more than 1500 NSCLC patients showed that RFC4 gene amplification, and high RFC4 and NICD1 levels were tightly correlated with NSCLC metastasis, progression and poor patient prognosis. Therefore, our study characterizes the pivotal roles of the positive feedback loop between RFC4 and NICD1 in coupling NSCLC metastasis and stemness properties and suggests its therapeutic and diagnostic/prognostic potential for NSCLC therapy.",

Temporal activation of multiple cancer hallmark pathways and acquisition of 17q are observed in a refractory MCL. Multi-platform validation is performed at genomic and cellular levels in PDX models and larger patient cohorts. We demonstrate that due to 17q gain, BIRC5/survivin expression is upregulated in resistant MCL tumor cells and targeting BIRC5 results in marked tumor inhibition in preclinical models. In addition, we discover notable differences in the tumor microenvironment including progressive dampening of CD8+ T cells and aberrant cell-to-cell communication networks in refractory MCLs.

Common copy-number alterations include Chromosome (Ch.) 1p loss/1q gain, and Ch. 13q and Ch. 14q loss; focal alterations include PDGFRA and CDK4 gain and CDKN2A and BCOR loss. Transcriptomically, RIGs comprise a stem-like subgroup with lesser mutation burden and Ch. 1p loss and a pro-inflammatory subgroup with greater mutation burden and depleted DNA repair gene expression. Chromothripsis in several RIG samples is associated with extrachromosomal circular DNA-mediated amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4.

PKR associates with 4.1R to promote anchorage-independent growth of hepatocellular carcinoma and lead to poor prognosis,"Yusuke Okujima, Takao Watanabe, Takeshi Ito, Yasumichi Inoue, Yutaka Kasai, Yusuke Imai, Yoshiko Nakamura, Mitsuhito Koizumi, Osamu Yoshida, Yoshio Tokumoto, Masashi Hirooka, Masanori Abe, Ryosuke Kawakami, Takashi Saitou, Takeshi Imamura, Yoshinori Murakami, Yoichi Hiasa",2024-11-13,"RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) may have a positive regulatory role in controlling tumor growth and progression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the downstream substrates and the molecular mechanism of PKR in the growth and progression of HCC have not been clarified. In this study, mass spectrometry analysis was performed with immunoprecipitated samples, and 4.1R was identified as a protein that binds to PKR. In transfected COS7 cells, an immunoprecipitation experiment showed that 4.1R binds to wild-type PKR, but not to a kinase-deficient mutant PKR, suggesting that PKR binds to 4.1R in a kinase activity-dependent manner. In HCC cell lines, HuH7 and HepG2, the expression level of 4.1R protein was shown to be regulated by protein expression and activation of PKR. Interestingly, high expression of 4.1R, as well as PKR, is associated with a worse prognosis in HCC. PKR increased HCC cell growth in both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent manners, whereas 4.1R was involved in HCC cell growth only in an anchorage-independent manner, not in an anchorage-dependent manner. The rescue experiment indicated that increased anchorage-independent growth of HCC cells by PKR might be caused by 4.1R. In conclusion, PKR associates with 4.1R and promotes anchorage-independent growth of HCC. The PKR-4.1R axis might be a new therapeutic target in HCC.","eIF-2 kinase, Erythrocyte membrane band 4.1 protein, Liver neoplasms, Cell line, Prognosis"

We show that the pre-, on-treatment and dynamic changes of the immune state, tumor metabolic proteins and tumor cell gene expression profiling-based metabolic phenotype are associated with treatment response. Single-cell/nucleus RNA sequencing revealed distinct tumor and immune cell states in metabolism between cold and hot tumors. Potential drivers of NAC based on above analyses were validated in vitro. In summary, the study shows that the interaction of tumor-intrinsic metabolic states and TME is associated with treatment outcome, supporting the concept of targeting tumor metabolism for immunoregulation.",
Comparing cancer stage at diagnosis between migrants and non-migrants: a meta-analysis,"Adam Harvey-Sullivan, Sana Ali, Parveen Dhesi, Joseph Hart, Helena Painter, Fiona M.

Diagnostic delays result in later stage diagnosis which is associated with poorer cancer survival. This review aims to compare the differences in cancer stage at diagnosis between migrants and non-migrants.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of three databases from 2000 to 2023 for studies conducted in OECD countries that compared stage at diagnosis between migrants and non-migrants. Meta-analysis compared odds ratios (OR) for early (stage I and II) stage at diagnosis. The Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Exposure tool was used to assess study quality.Results41 of the 11,549 studies identified were included; 34 studies had suitable data for meta-analysis. Overall, migrants were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with early stage cancer compared with non-migrants (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.78–0.91). This difference was maintained across cancer types, although only statistically significant for breast (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.70–0.87) and prostate cancer (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.85–0.99).DiscussionPublished studies indicate that migrants are less likely to be diagnosed with early stage cancer.

Bridging the macro to micro resolution gap with angiographic optical coherence tomography and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI,"W. Jeffrey Zabel, Nader Allam, Warren D. Foltz, Costel Flueraru, Edward Taylor, I. Alex Vitkin",2022-02-24,"Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is emerging as a valuable tool for non-invasive volumetric monitoring of the tumor vascular status and its therapeutic response. However, clinical utility of DCE-MRI is challenged by uncertainty in its ability to quantify the tumor microvasculature (\(\mu \mathrm{m}\) scale) given its relatively poor spatial resolution (mm scale at best). To address this challenge, we directly compared DCE-MRI parameter maps with co-registered micron-scale-resolution speckle variance optical coherence tomography (svOCT) microvascular images in a window chamber tumor mouse model. Both semi and fully quantitative (Toft’s model) DCE-MRI metrics were tested for correlation with microvascular svOCT biomarkers. svOCT’s derived vascular volume fraction (VVF) and the mean distance to nearest vessel (\(\overline{\mathrm{DNV} }\)) metrics were correlated with DCE-MRI vascular biomarkers such as time to peak contrast enhancement (\(r=-0.81\) and \(0.83\) respectively, \(P<0.0001\) for both), the area under the gadolinium-time concentration curve (\(r=0.50\) and \(-0.48\) respectively, \(P<0.0001\) for both) and \({k}_{trans}\) (\(r=0.64\) and \(-0.61\) respectively, \(P<0.0001\) for both). Several other correlated micro–macro vascular metric pairs were also noted. The microvascular insights afforded by svOCT may help improve the clinical utility of DCE-MRI for tissue functional status assessment and therapeutic response monitoring applications.",
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius mediates anti-PD1 therapy resistance and exacerbates colorectal cancer via myeloid-derived suppressor cells in mice,"Yali Liu, Chi Chun Wong, Yanqiang Ding, Mengxue Gao, Jun Wen, Harry Cheuk-Hay Lau, Alvin Ho-Kwan Cheung, Dan Huang, He Huang, Jun Yu",2024-05-15,"Bacteria such as the oral microbiome member Peptostreptococcus anaerobius can exacerbate colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Little is known regarding whether these immunomodulatory bacteria also affect antitumour immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Here we show that administration of P. anaerobius abolished the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in mouse models of CRC. P. anaerobius both induced intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and stimulated their immunosuppressive activities to impair effective T cell responses. Mechanistically, P. anaerobius administration activated integrin α2β1–NF-κB signalling in CRC cells to induce secretion of CXCL1 and recruit CXCR2+ MDSCs into tumours. The bacterium also directly activated immunosuppressive activity of intratumoral MDSCs by secreting lytC_22, a protein that bound to the Slamf4 receptor on MDSCs and promoted ARG1 and iNOS expression. Finally, therapeutic targeting of either integrin α2β1 or the Slamf4 receptor were revealed as promising strategies to overcome P. anaerobius-mediated resistance to anti-PD1 therapy in CRC.",

Critically, PIAS2b-dsRNAi does not affect growth of normal or non-anaplastic thyroid tumor cultures (differentiated carcinoma, benign lesions) or cell lines. PIAS2b-dsRNAi also has an anti-cancer effect on other anaplastic human cancers (pancreas, lung, and gastric). Mechanistically, PIAS2b is required for proper mitotic spindle and centrosome assembly, and it is a dosage-sensitive protein in ATC. PIAS2b depletion promotes mitotic catastrophe at prophase. High-throughput proteomics reveals the proteasome (PSMC5) and spindle cytoskeleton (TUBB3) to be direct targets of PIAS2b SUMOylation at mitotic initiation. These results identify PIAS2b-dsRNAi as a promising therapy for ATC and other aggressive anaplastic carcinomas.",

Despite the recent advancements in cancer treatment, there is currently no approved therapy for metastasis. The present study reveals a potent and selective activity of PRAK in the regulation of tumor metastasis. While showing no apparent effect on the growth of primary breast cancers or subcutaneously inoculated tumor lines, Prak deficiency abrogates lung metastases in PyMT mice or mice receiving intravenous injection of tumor cells. Consistently, PRAK expression is closely associated with metastatic risk in human cancers. Further analysis indicates that loss of function of PRAK leads to a pronounced inhibition of HIF-1α protein synthesis, possibly due to reduced mTORC1 activities. Notably, pharmacological inactivation of PRAK with a clinically relevant inhibitor recapitulates the anti-metastatic effect of Prak depletion, highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting PRAK in the control of metastasis.",

Downregulation of enhancer RNA AC003092.1 is associated with poor prognosis in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma,"JunJie Li, JingZheng Gan, Chen Chen, Yuan Yuan, Xi Xiong, Lili Li, Pengcheng Luo, Wei Zhang",2024-06-12,"Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) is the most common histological type of renal cancer, enhancer RNA plays a significant role in tumor growth, however, it has been less studied in renal cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of eRNA AC003092.1 in KIRC. Clinical and RNA expression data were downloaded from a TCGA database, and performed bioinformatics analysis, including expression level analysis, survival analysis, clinical correlation analysis, immune correlation analysis. We further confirmed the expression level of AC003092.1 between normal and tumor cell, predicted the biological role of AC003092.1 in KIRC, and performed cell proliferation and wound healing assays, followed by GSEA enrichment analysis and western blot to detect the proteins of the enriched pathway. Bioinformatics results showed that AC003092.1 expression was elevated in tumor tissues, and knockdown of AC003092.1 expression inhibited cell proliferation and migration. GSEA and western blot results showed that knockdown AC003092.1 expression alleviated the extracellular matrix (ECM) process in KIRC cell lines. Our study provides evidence that AC003092.1 play an important role in KIRC, and AC003092.1 may promote tumor cell progression by affecting the ECM process during tumor development.",

We analyzed IDO1 promoter methylation and its relationship with survival, patient prognosis, immune cell infiltration, immune-related pathways, and the expression of key immunomodulators via bioinformatics methods in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer cohort (779 samples). Furthermore, the IDO1 promoter methylation status and expression of the IDO1 gene in the basal subtype of breast cancer were investigated in vitro via a methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The IDO1 promoter was significantly hypomethylated in the basal subtype of breast cancer tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues, and this effect was correlated with high expression of IDO1, resulting in abundant immune cell infiltration, activation of immune-related pathways, and upregulation of key immunomodulators. The influence of IDO1 promoter hypomethylation on the prognosis of patients with breast cancer was also investigated. The promoter hypomethylation of IDO1 in the basal subtype of breast cancer and its correlation with high expression of IDO1 were also investigated in vitro. Our results showed that IDO1 promoter methylation is vital for regulating its expression, which leads to the development of a tumor microenvironment in breast cancer. IDO1 promoter methylation and expression are associated with prognosis, immune cell infiltration, immune-related pathways, and immunomodulator expression in breast cancer. Our findings provide evidence for the validation of IDO1 promoter methylation as a promising biomarker to predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with breast cancer.","DNA methylation, Epigenetics, Biomarker, IDO1, Breast cancer, Tumor immune microenvironment"
Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade induces T cell and cDC1 activation but fails to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor associated macrophages in recurrent glioblastoma,"Alexander H. Lee, Lu Sun, Aaron Y. Mochizuki, Jeremy G. Reynoso, Joey Orpilla, Frances Chow, Jenny C. Kienzler, Richard G. Everson, David A. Nathanson, Steven J. Bensinger, Linda M. Liau, Timothy Cloughesy, Willy Hugo, Robert M. Prins",2021-11-26,"Primary brain tumors, such as glioblastoma (GBM), are remarkably resistant to immunotherapy, even though pre-clinical models suggest effectiveness. To understand this better in patients, here we take advantage of our recent neoadjuvant treatment paradigm to map the infiltrating immune cell landscape of GBM and how this is altered following PD-1 checkpoint blockade using high dimensional proteomics, single cell transcriptomics, and quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence. Neoadjuvant PD-1 blockade increases T cell infiltration and the proportion of a progenitor exhausted population of T cells found within the tumor. We identify an early activated and clonally expanded CD8+ T cell cluster whose TCR overlaps with a CD8+ PBMC population. Distinct changes are also observed in conventional type 1 dendritic cells that may facilitate T cell recruitment. Macrophages and monocytes still constitute the majority of infiltrating immune cells, even after anti-PD-1 therapy. Interferon-mediated changes in the myeloid population are consistently observed following PD-1 blockade; these also mediate an increase in chemotactic factors that recruit T cells. However, sustained high expression of T-cell-suppressive checkpoints in these myeloid cells continue to prevent the optimal activation of the tumor infiltrating T cells. Therefore, future immunotherapeutic strategies may need to incorporate the targeting of these cells for clinical benefit.",

Patients refractory or intolerant to standard therapies received TAS-102 (30–35 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1–5 and days 8–12 every 28 days) plus bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on days 1 and 15. Clinical and pathological characteristics, overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) data were collected and analysed. Thirty-five patients were treated from July 2019 to October 2021 (median age 64 years). The majority of patients (68.6%) were receiving TAS-102 plus bevacizumab as third-line treatment. Patients received a median of 4 (range 2–15) cycles of treatment. Among 31 patients evaluable for response (88.6%), ORR and DCR were 3.2% and 51.6%, respectively. After a median 11.6 months’ follow-up, median PFS was 4.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4–5.1) months and median OS was 9.3 (95% CI 6.6–12.1) months.

Pan-cancer landscape analysis of NOP58 and its oncogenic driving role in lung adenocarcinoma,"Shushu Qian, Huafeng Liu, Min Zhang, Li Zhang, Yunlan Dai, Xiangming Ye, Wanshun Wen, Ruidong Cheng",2024-11-11,"Despite improvements in treatment in recent years, patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) still face poor prognoses. In this study, we elucidated the potential role of NOP58 ribonucleoprotein in pan-cancer and validated its oncogenic significance in LUAD using bioinformatics and in vitro and in vivo functional assays. NOP58 was found to be overexpressed in various types of tumors. It had great precision for predicting 20 distinct cancer types using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) as well as significant connections with the prognoses in particular cancers. In LUAD, NOP58 expression was correlated substantially with the TNM stage, pathologic stage, smoking status, and effectiveness endpoints, when we analyzed its association with clinical characteristics in LUAD. Elevated NOP58 expression was shown as connected with Th2 cell infiltration while also negatively linked with infiltrating other immune cells, such as CD8 T, cytotoxic, and Th1. By inhibiting NOP58 within the LUAD cells, we found a decrease in cells’ capability to proliferate, migrate, and invade. Knockdown of NOP58 inhibited tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Furthermore, the tissue microarray study indicated that there was a greater expression of NOP58 in the tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues in LUAD. Our findings revealed that NOP58 could be an outstanding bio-index for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis and an independent prognostic risk factor in LUAD.","NOP58 ribonucleoprotein, Lung adenocarcinoma, Pan-cancer, Prognosis, Immune infiltrate"
Colorectal carcinoma progression is not influenced by the pseudokinase PEAK1,"Alba Zuidema, Paul Atherton, Sabine van der Poel, Maaike Kreft, Ji-Ying Song, Martine Bierbooms, Sophie Verhoeven, Chrysoula Papagianni, Lona Kroese, Rahmen Bin Ali, Ivo Huijbers, Beatriz Carvalho, Arnoud Sonnenberg",2024-11-12,"The scaffold protein PEAK1 acts downstream of integrin adhesion complexes and the epidermal growth factor receptor, orchestrating signaling events that control cell proliferation and cytoskeletal remodeling. In this study we investigated the role of PEAK1 in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) progression using various in vitro and in vivo models to replicate the stepwise pathogenesis of CRC. While we observed a cell-type specific role for PEAK1 in the proliferation and in human CRC cell lines in vitro, our in vivo experiments using different CRC mouse models driven by loss of Apc, with or without oncogenic Kras or Pten loss suggest that PEAK1 does not significantly contribute to tumor formation in vivo. However, the survival time of Peak1−/− mice in the Apcfl/+ model appeared to be slightly increased. Furthermore, PEAK1 promotes EGF-induced Caco-2 cell proliferation and regulates spheroid polarization and lumenization. Given that the Caco-2 cells harbor mutations in the tumor suppressors APC and β-CATENIN, but not in other tumor suppressors or in proto-oncogenes, we conclude that the PEAK1’s impact on colon carcinogenesis is limited, potentially playing a role in the initial stage of the adenoma to carcinoma progression.","PEAK1, Colorectal carcinoma, KRAS, APC, PTEN, EGF"
FADS2 confers SCD1 inhibition resistance to cancer cells by modulating the ER stress response,"Toshikatsu Ikeda, Yuki Katoh, Hirotsugu Hino, Daichi Seta, Tadashi Ogawa, Takashi Iwata, Hiroshi Nishio, Masaki Sugawara, Shuichi Hirai",2024-06-07,"Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, the clinical efficacy of SCD1 inhibitor monotherapy is limited. There is thus a need to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance to SCD1 inhibition and develop new therapeutic strategies for combination therapy. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells acquire resistance to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-dependent cancer cell death induced by SCD1 inhibition. SCD1 inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant cancer cells were treated with SCD1 inhibitors in vitro, and SCD1 inhibitor-sensitive cancer cells accumulated palmitic acid and underwent ER stress response-induced cell death. Conversely, SCD1-resistant cancer cells did not undergo ER stress response-induced cell death because fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2) eliminated the accumulation of palmitic acid. Furthermore, genetic depletion using siRNA showed that FADS2 is a key determinant of sensitivity/resistance of cancer cells to SCD1 inhibitor. A549 cells, an SCD1 inhibitor-resistant cancer cell line, underwent ER stress-dependent cancer cell death upon dual inhibition of SCD1 and FADS2. Thus, combination therapy with SCD1 inhibition and FADS2 inhibition is potentially a new cancer therapeutic strategy targeting fatty acid metabolism.","Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), Fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Palmitic acid"

A total of 706patients with mRCC treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)between January 2007 and June 2020 (i.e., sunitinib, pazopanib) were included in this study. SII was calculated in 621 patients with the following formula:[neutrophil (cellsx109/L) x platelet (cellsx109/L)] / lymphocyte (cellsx109/L).All patients were classified into SII-high and SII-low groups based on the cut-off value of SII at 756, which was the median SII level of our study group. The minimal follow-up duration was 10 months in all cohorts. The median age of patients was 60 (interquartile range (IQR):53–67) years. Three out of four patients were male. The majority of patients (85.7%) had clear cell histology, and sarcomatoid differentiation was observed in 16.9% of all patients. There were 311 and 310 patients in the SII-low and SII-high groups, respectively. In general, baseline characteristics were similar in each group. However, the rate of patients treated with sunitinib (63.3% vs. 49.0%, p < 0.001) and those who underwent nephrectomy (83.6% vs. 64.2%, p < 0.001) was higher in the SII-low group than in the SII-high group.

Similarly, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in the SII-low group than in the SII-high group (18.0 months vs. 7.7 months, p < 0.001).In multivariableanalysis, SII was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio (HR):1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.05–1.85, p = 0.01) and PFS (HR:1.60, 95% CI:1.24–2.05, p < 0.001).Pre-treatment level of high SII might be considered a predictor of poor prognosisin patients with mRCC treated with TKIs.",
SNPs and blood inflammatory marker featured machine learning for predicting the efficacy of fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in colorectal cancer,"Jiyifan Li, Wenxin Zhang, Lu Chen, Xiang Mao, Xinhai Wang, Jiafeng Liu, Yuxin Huang, Huijie Qi, Li Chen, Huanying Shi, Bicui Chen, Mingkang Zhong, Qunyi Li, Tianxiao Wang",2024-11-12,"Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy responses in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients vary widely, highlighting the role of pharmacogenomics in developing better predictive models. We analyzed 379 CRC patients receiving fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, collecting data on fluorouracil metabolism-related SNPs (TYMS, MTHFR, DPYD, RRM1), blood inflammatory markers, and clinical status. Six machine learning models—K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), LightGBM, and random forest—were compared against multivariate logistic regression and a deep learning model (i.e., multilayer perceptron, MLP). Feature importance analysis highlighted seven predictors: histological grade, N and M staging, monocyte count, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, MTHFR rs1801131, and RRM1 rs11030918. In a five-fold cross-validation, XGBoost and GBDT exhibited superior performance, with Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.88 ± 0.02. XGBoost excelled in identifying favorable prognosis (recall = 0.939). GBDT demonstrated balance in recognizing both categories, with a recall for favorable prognosis of 0.908 and a precision for unfavorable prognosis of 0.863. MLP had a similar AUC (0.87) with high precision for favorable prognosis (recall = 0.946). In external validation, XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 0.79.

Ferritinophagy mediates adaptive resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer,"Hui Wang, Qianfan Hu, Yuzhong Chen, Xing Huang, Yipeng Feng, Yuanjian Shi, Rutao Li, Xuewen Yin, Xuming Song, Yingkuan Liang, Te Zhang, Lin Xu, Gaochao Dong, Feng Jiang",2024-05-17,"Osimertinib (Osi) is a widely used epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). However, the emergence of resistance is inevitable, partly due to the gradual evolution of adaptive resistant cells during initial treatment. Here, we find that Osi treatment rapidly triggers adaptive resistance in tumor cells. Metabolomics analysis reveals a significant enhancement of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Osi adaptive-resistant cells. Mechanically, Osi treatment induces an elevation of NCOA4, a key protein of ferritinophagy, which maintains the synthesis of iron-sulfur cluster (ISC) proteins of electron transport chain and OXPHOS. Additionally, active ISC protein synthesis in adaptive-resistant cells significantly increases the sensitivity to copper ions. Combining Osi with elesclomol, a copper ion ionophore, significantly increases the efficacy of Osi, with no additional toxicity. Altogether, this study reveals the mechanisms of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in Osi adaptive resistance and introduces a promising new therapy of combining copper ionophores to improve its initial efficacy.",

Here we show that modelling of intermittent ceralasertib treatment in mouse tumor models reveals CD8+ T-cell dependent antitumor activity, which is separate from the effects on tumor cells. Ceralasertib suppresses proliferating CD8+ T-cells on treatment which is rapidly reversed off-treatment. Ceralasertib causes up-regulation of type I interferon (IFNI) pathway in cancer patients and in tumor-bearing mice. IFNI is experimentally found to be a major mediator of antitumor activity of ceralasertib in combination with PD-L1 antibody. Improvement of T-cell function after ceralasertib treatment is linked to changes in myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment. IFNI also promotes anti-proliferative effects of ceralasertib on tumor cells. Here, we report that broad immunomodulatory changes following intermittent ATR inhibition underpins the clinical therapeutic benefit and indicates its wider impact on antitumor immunity.",

Thirteen species are classified as oral-translocated and enriched in NPC patients. Among these, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia are validated through culturomics and clonal strain identification. Nasopharyngeal biopsy meta-transcriptomes confirm these microbes within tumors, influencing local microenvironment and cytokine response. These microbes correlate significantly with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) loads in the nasopharynx, exhibiting an increased dose-response relationship.

synNotch-programmed iPSC-derived NK cells usurp TIGIT and CD73 activities for glioblastoma therapy,"Kyle B. Lupo, Xue Yao, Shambhavi Borde, Jiao Wang, Sandra Torregrosa-Allen, Bennett D. Elzey, Sagar Utturkar, Nadia A. Lanman, MacKenzie McIntosh, Sandro Matosevic",2024-03-01,"Severe heterogeneity within glioblastoma has spurred the notion that disrupting the interplay between multiple elements on immunosuppression is at the core of meaningful anti-tumor responses. T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) and its glioblastoma-associated antigen, CD155, form a highly immunosuppressive axis in glioblastoma and other solid tumors, yet targeting of TIGIT, a functionally heterogeneous receptor on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, has largely been ineffective as monotherapy, suggesting that disruption of its inhibitory network might be necessary for measurable responses. It is within this context that we show that the usurpation of the TIGIT − CD155 axis via engineered synNotch-mediated activation of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived natural killer (NK) cells promotes transcription factor-mediated activation of a downstream signaling cascade that results in the controlled, localized blockade of CD73 to disrupt purinergic activity otherwise resulting in the production and accumulation of immunosuppressive extracellular adenosine. Such “decoy” receptor engages CD155 binding to TIGIT, but tilts inhibitory TIGIT/CD155 interactions toward activation via downstream synNotch signaling. Usurping activities of TIGIT and CD73 promotes the function of adoptively transferred NK cells into intracranial patient-derived models of glioblastoma and enhances their natural cytolytic functions against this tumor to result in complete tumor eradication. In addition, targeting both receptors, in turn, reprograms the glioblastoma microenvironment via the recruitment of T cells and the downregulation of M2 macrophages. This study demonstrates that TIGIT/CD155 and CD73 are targetable receptor partners in glioblastoma. Our data show that synNotch-engineered pluripotent stem cell-derived NK cells are not only effective mediators of anti-glioblastoma responses within the setting of CD73 and TIGIT/CD155 co-targeting, but represent a powerful allogeneic treatment option for this tumor.",

Severely polarized extracellular acidity around tumour cells,"Qiang Feng, Zachary Bennett, Anthony Grichuk, Raymundo Pantoja, Tongyi Huang, Brandon Faubert, Gang Huang, Mingyi Chen, Ralph J. DeBerardinis, Baran D. Sumer, Jinming Gao",2024-03-04,"Extracellular pH impacts many molecular, cellular and physiological processes, and hence is tightly regulated. Yet, in tumours, dysregulated cancer cell metabolism and poor vascular perfusion cause the tumour microenvironment to become acidic. Here by leveraging fluorescent pH nanoprobes with a transistor-like activation profile at a pH of 5.3, we show that, in cancer cells, hydronium ions are excreted into a small extracellular region. Such severely polarized acidity (pH <5.3) is primarily caused by the directional co-export of protons and lactate, as we show for a diverse panel of cancer cell types via the genetic knockout or inhibition of monocarboxylate transporters, and also via nanoprobe activation in multiple tumour models in mice. We also observed that such spot acidification in ex vivo stained snap-frozen human squamous cell carcinoma tissue correlated with the expression of monocarboxylate transporters and with the exclusion of cytotoxic T cells. Severely spatially polarized tumour acidity could be leveraged for cancer diagnosis and therapy.",
The evolutionary impact of childhood cancer on the human gene pool,"Ulrik Kristoffer Stoltze, Jon Foss-Skiftesvik, Thomas van Overeem Hansen, Simon Rasmussen, Konrad J. Karczewski, Karin A. W.

Here, we analyze publicly available germline genetic metadata from 4,574 children with cancer [11 studies; 1,083 whole exome sequences (WES), 1,950 whole genome sequences (WGS), and 1,541 gene panel] and 141,456 adults [125,748 WES and 15,708 WGS]. We find that pediatric cancer predisposition syndrome (pCPS) genes [n = 85] are highly constrained, harboring only a quarter of the loss-of-function variants that would be expected. This strong indication of selective pressure on pCPS genes is found across multiple lines of germline genomics data from both pediatric and adult cohorts. For six genes [ELP1, GPR161, VHL and SDHA/B/C], a clear lack of mutational constraint calls the pediatric penetrance and/or severity of associated cancers into question. Conversely, out of 23 known pCPS genes associated with biallelic risk, two [9%, DIS3L2 and MSH2] show significant constraint, indicating that they may monoallelically increase childhood cancer risk. In summary, we show that population genetic data provide empirical evidence that heritable childhood cancer leads to natural selection powerful enough to have significantly impacted the present-day gene pool.",

Here we identify predictive markers of response, based on whole-genome DNA (n = 70) and RNA-sequencing (n = 41) of fresh metastatic biopsy samples, collected prior to treatment with pembrolizumab. We find that PD-L1 combined positivity score does not, whereas tumor mutational burden and APOBEC mutagenesis modestly predict response. In contrast, T cell-to-stroma enrichment (TSE) score, computed from gene expression signature data to capture the relative abundance of T cells and stromal cells, predicts response to immunotherapy with high accuracy. Patients with a positive and negative TSE score show progression free survival rates at 6 months of 67 and 0%, respectively. The abundance of T cells and stromal cells, as reflected by the TSE score is confirmed by immunofluorescence in tumor tissue, and its good performance in two independent ICI-treated cohorts of patients with mUC (IMvigor210) and muscle-invasive UC (ABACUS) validate the predictive power of the TSE score. In conclusion, the TSE score represents a clinically applicable metric that potentially supports the prospective selection of patients with mUC for ICI treatment.",

A nine-emitter ultrasound implant was placed at the end of tumor resection replacing the bone flap. After surgery, activation to disrupt the BBB was performed every four weeks either before or after carboplatin infusion. The primary objective of the Phase 1 was to evaluate the safety of escalating numbers of ultrasound emitters using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation. The primary objective of the Phase 2 was to evaluate the efficacy of BBB opening using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The secondary objectives included safety and clinical efficacy. Thirty-three patients received a total of 90 monthly sonications with carboplatin administration and up to nine emitters activated without observed DLT. Grade 3 procedure-related adverse events consisted of pre syncope (n = 3), fatigue (n = 1), wound infection (n = 2), and pain at time of device connection (n = 7). BBB opening endpoint was met with 90% of emitters showing BBB disruption on MRI after sonication. In the 12 patients who received carboplatin just prior to sonication, the progression-free survival was 3.1 months, the 1-year overall survival rate was 58% and median overall survival was 14.0 months from surgery.",
Epigenetic regulation of CD38/CD48 by KDM6A mediates NK cell response in multiple myeloma,"Jiye Liu, Lijie Xing, Jiang Li, Kenneth Wen, Ning Liu, Yuntong Liu, Gongwei Wu, Su Wang, Daisuke Ogiya, Tian-Yu Song, Keiji Kurata, Johany Penailillo, Eugenio Morelli, Tingjian Wang, Xiaoning Hong, Annamaria Gulla, Yu-Tzu Tai, Nikhil Munshi, Paul Richardson, Ruben Carrasco, Teru Hideshima, Kenneth C. Anderson",2024-02-14,"Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies like Daratumumab (Dara) are effective in multiple myeloma (MM); however, drug resistance ultimately occurs and the mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. Here, we identify, via two in vitro genome-wide CRISPR screens probing Daratumumab resistance, KDM6A as an important regulator of sensitivity to Daratumumab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Loss of KDM6A leads to increased levels of H3K27me3 on the promoter of CD38, resulting in a marked downregulation in CD38 expression, which may cause resistance to Daratumumab-mediated ADCC. Re-introducing CD38 does not reverse Daratumumab-mediated ADCC fully, which suggests that additional KDM6A targets, including CD48 which is also downregulated upon KDM6A loss, contribute to Daratumumab-mediated ADCC. Inhibition of H3K27me3 with an EZH2 inhibitor resulted in CD38 and CD48 upregulation and restored sensitivity to Daratumumab. These findings suggest KDM6A loss as a mechanism of Daratumumab resistance and lay down the proof of principle for the therapeutic application of EZH2 inhibitors, one of which is already FDA-approved, in improving MM responsiveness to Daratumumab.",
Evaluation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for clinical T1 triple-negative breast cancer,"Qian Hao, Luyao Dai, Lidan Chang, Dingli Song, Dandan Liu, Xiaobin Ma, Hao Wu, Huafeng Kang",2024-08-05,"The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and its benefits in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and small tumors are unclear. This study aims to compare survival differences between clinical T1 TNBC receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and adjuvant chemotherapy (AC). Data for patients with clinical T1 TNBC were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patients were categorized according to whether they received chemotherapy before or after surgery. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) was used to minimize the influence of confounding factors. OS and BCSS were compared between the two treatment sequences using Kaplan–Meier and univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. The study included 6249 women with T1 TNBC. In multivariate analysis, compared with that in the AC group, the hazard ratio for death in the NAC group was 1.54 (95% confidence interval 1.26–1.89, p < 0.001). NAC offers no additional benefits in any age group or T, N subgroups. Our findings suggest that NAC does not provide additional benefit to patients with clinical T1 TNBC, even in the presence of lymph node metastasis, or T1c.","T1 triple-negative breast cancer, Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, Overall survival, Breast cancer-specific survival, SEER"
Adhesion of pancreatic tumor cell clusters by desmosomal molecules enhances early liver metastases formation,"Niclas Dietrich, Ramon Castellanos-Martinez, Julia Kemmling, Arnd Heuser, Michael Schnoor, Camilla Schinner, Volker Spindler",2024-08-06,"Desmosomes are intercellular adhesion complexes providing mechanical coupling and tissue integrity. Previously, a correlation of desmosomal molecule expression with invasion and metastasis formation in several tumor entities was described together with a relevance for circulating tumor cell cluster formation. Here, we investigated the contribution of the desmosomal core adhesion molecule desmoglein-2 (DSG2) to the initial steps of liver metastasis formation by pancreatic cancer cells using a novel ex vivo liver perfusion mouse model. We applied the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line AsPC-1 with and without a knockout (KO) of DSG2 and generated mouse lines with a hepatocyte-specific KO of the known interacting partners of DSG2 (DSG2 and desmocollin-2). Liver perfusion with DSG2 KO AsPC-1 cells led to smaller circulating cell clusters and a reduced number of cells adhering to murine livers compared to control cells. While this was independent of the expression levels of desmosomal adhesion molecules in hepatocytes, we show that increased cluster size of cancer cells, which correlates with stronger cell–cell adhesion and expression of desmosomal molecules, is a major factor contributing to the early phase of metastatic spreading. In conclusion, impaired desmosomal adhesion results in reduced circulating cell cluster size, which is relevant for seeding and attachment of metastatic cells to the liver.",
Diagnostic accuracy of the breast MRI Kaiser score in suspected architectural distortions and its comparison with mammography,"Ozge Aslan, Aysenur Oktay",2024-01-03,"Suspicious architectural distortion is an elusive finding in breast cancer diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Kaiser score for suspicious architectural distortions observed on mammography and compare it with the BI-RADS score of the lesion. Mammograms performed between January 2013 and March 2023 were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of suspicious architectural distortion. Forty-one patients, who had at least 1 year of radiological follow-up or pathology results, and underwent breast MRI, were included in the study. Mammography findings and the BI-RADS category of the lesion were assessed. MRI findings were evaluated and Kaiser scoring was performed according to the tree flowchart. Ninety-one percent of the enhanced lesions had a Kaiser score of 5 and above. In the diagnosis of malignancy, the Kaiser score yielded an accuracy of 75.61% (AUC 0.833). A statistically significant correlation was observed indicating that a malignant diagnosis was more prevalent in patients with a Kaiser score of 5 and above (p < 0.05). Additionally statistically significant relationship was also observed between the BI-RADS category of architectural distortions on mammography and the Kaiser score (p = 0.007). The combined utilization of mammography findings and the evidence-based Kaiser score in suspected architectural distortions provides more accurate results in the differential diagnosis of breast cancer.",

We established a comprehensive multiomics cohort of 773 Chinese patients with breast cancer and systematically analyzed their genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, radiomic and digital pathology characteristics. Here we show that compared to breast cancers in white individuals, Asian individuals had more targetable AKT1 mutations. Integrated analysis revealed a higher proportion of HER2-enriched subtype and correspondingly more frequent ERBB2 amplification and higher HER2 protein abundance in the Chinese HR+HER2+ cohort, stressing anti-HER2 therapy for these individuals. Furthermore, comprehensive metabolomic and proteomic analyses revealed ferroptosis as a potential therapeutic target for basal-like tumors. The integration of clinical, transcriptomic, metabolomic, radiomic and pathological features allowed for efficient stratification of patients into groups with varying recurrence risks. Our study provides a public resource and new insights into the biology and ancestry specificity of breast cancer in the Asian population, offering potential for further precision treatment approaches.",
A phospho-switch controls RNF43-mediated degradation of Wnt receptors to suppress tumorigenesis,"Tadasuke Tsukiyama, Juqi Zou, Jihoon Kim, Shohei Ogamino, Yuki Shino, Takamasa Masuda, Alessandra Merenda, Masaki Matsumoto, Yoichiro Fujioka, Tomonori Hirose, Sayuri Terai, Hidehisa Takahashi, Tohru Ishitani, Keiichi I. Nakayama, Yusuke Ohba, Bon-Kyoung Koo, Shigetsugu Hatakeyama",2020-09-15,"Frequent mutation of the tumour suppressor RNF43 is observed in many cancers, particularly colon malignancies. RNF43, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, negatively regulates Wnt signalling by inducing degradation of the Wnt receptor Frizzled. In this study, we discover that RNF43 activity requires phosphorylation at a triplet of conserved serines. This phospho-regulation of RNF43 is required for zebrafish development and growth of mouse intestinal organoids. Cancer-associated mutations that abrogate RNF43 phosphorylation cooperate with active Ras to promote tumorigenesis by abolishing the inhibitory function of RNF43 in Wnt signalling while maintaining its inhibitory function in p53 signalling. Our data suggest that RNF43 mutations cooperate with KRAS mutations to promote multi-step tumorigenesis via the Wnt-Ras-p53 axis in human colon cancers. Lastly, phosphomimetic substitutions of the serine trio restored the tumour suppressive activity of extracellular oncogenic mutants. Therefore, harnessing phospho-regulation of RNF43 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for tumours with RNF43 mutations.",
The X-linked trichothiodystrophy-causing gene RNF113A links the spliceosome to cell survival upon DNA damage,"Kateryna Shostak, Zheshen Jiang, Benoit Charloteaux, Alice Mayer, Yvette Habraken, Lars Tharun, Sebastian Klein, Xinyi Xu, Hong Quan Duong, Andrii Vislovukh, Pierre Close, Alexandra Florin, Florian Rambow, Jean-Christophe Marine, Reinhard Büttner, Alain Chariot",2020-03-09,"Prolonged cell survival occurs through the expression of specific protein isoforms generated by alternate splicing of mRNA precursors in cancer cells. How alternate splicing regulates tumor development and resistance to targeted therapies in cancer remain poorly understood. Here we show that RNF113A, whose loss-of-function causes the X-linked trichothiodystrophy, is overexpressed in lung cancer and protects from Cisplatin-dependent cell death. RNF113A is a RNA-binding protein which regulates the splicing of multiple candidates involved in cell survival. RNF113A deficiency triggers cell death upon DNA damage through multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis via the destabilization of the prosurvival protein MCL-1, ferroptosis due to enhanced SAT1 expression, and increased production of ROS due to altered Noxa1 expression. RNF113A deficiency circumvents the resistance to Cisplatin and to BCL-2 inhibitors through the destabilization of MCL-1, which thus defines spliceosome inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to treat tumors showing acquired resistance to specific drugs due to MCL-1 stabilization.",

Tsen, Samuel Achilefu",2020-03-09,"The heterogeneity and continuous genetic adaptation of tumours complicate their detection and treatment via the targeting of genetic mutations. However, hallmarks of cancer such as aberrant protein phosphorylation and calcium-mediated cell signalling provide broadly conserved molecular targets. Here, we show that, for a range of solid tumours, a cyclic octapeptide labelled with a near-infrared dye selectively binds to phosphorylated Annexin A2 (pANXA2), with high affinity at high levels of calcium. Because of cancer-cell-induced pANXA2 expression in tumour-associated stromal cells, the octapeptide preferentially binds to the invasive edges of tumours and then traffics within macrophages to the tumour’s necrotic core. As proof-of-concept applications, we used the octapeptide to detect tumour xenografts and metastatic lesions, and to perform fluorescence-guided surgical tumour resection, in mice. Our findings suggest that high levels of pANXA2 in association with elevated calcium are present in the microenvironment of most solid cancers. The octapeptide might be broadly useful for selective tumour imaging and for delivering drugs to the edges and to the core of solid tumours.",
Establishing a 4D-CT lung function related volumetric dose model to reduce radiation pneumonia,"Chunmei Liu, Huizhi Liu, Yange Li, Zhiqing Xiao, Yanqiang Wang, Han Guo, Jianmin Luo",2024-06-01,"In order to study how to use pulmonary functional imaging obtained through 4D-CT fusion for radiotherapy planning, and transform traditional dose volume parameters into functional dose volume parameters, a functional dose volume parameter model that may reduce level 2 and above radiation pneumonia was obtained. 41 pulmonary tumor patients who underwent 4D-CT in our department from 2020 to 2023 were included. MIM Software (MIM 7.0.7; MIM Software Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) was used to register adjacent phase CT images in the 4D-CT series. The three-dimensional displacement vector of CT pixels was obtained when changing from one respiratory state to another respiratory state, and this three-dimensional vector was quantitatively analyzed. Thus, a color schematic diagram reflecting the degree of changes in lung CT pixels during the breathing process, namely the distribution of ventilation function strength, is obtained. Finally, this diagram is fused with the localization CT image. Select areas with Jacobi > 1.2 as high lung function areas and outline them as fLung. Import the patient's DVH image again, fuse the lung ventilation image with the localization CT image, and obtain the volume of fLung different doses (V60, V55, V50, V45, V40, V35, V30, V25, V20, V15, V10, V5). Analyze the functional dose volume parameters related to the risk of level 2 and above radiation pneumonia using R language and create a predictive model. By using stepwise regression and optimal subset method to screen for independent variables V35, V30, V25, V20, V15, and V10, the prediction formula was obtained as follows: Risk = 0.23656–0.13784 * V35 + 0.37445 * V30-0.38317 * V25 + 0.21341 * V20-0.10209 * V15 + 0.03815 * V10. These six independent variables were analyzed using a column chart, and a calibration curve was drawn using the calibrate function. It was found that the Bias corrected line and the Apparent line were very close to the Ideal line, The consistency between the predicted value and the actual value is very good. By using the ROC function to plot the ROC curve and calculating the area under the curve: 0.8475, 95% CI 0.7237–0.9713, it can also be determined that the accuracy of the model is very high. In addition, we also used Lasso method and random forest method to filter out independent variables with different results, but the calibration curve drawn by the calibration function confirmed poor prediction performance. The function dose volume parameters V35, V30, V25, V20, V15, and V10 obtained through 4D-CT are key factors affecting radiation pneumonia. Establishing a predictive model can provide more accurate lung restriction basis for clinical radiotherapy planning.","Lung cancer, 4D-CT, Functional imaging, Radiation pneumonia"
"Multiple pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma, based on a study of 36 cases worldwide","Pan He, Jianwei Wang, Jiong Guo, Shunqi Li, Weidong Zhang",2024-05-28,"To analyze the clinical characteristics and to improve clinicians’ understanding of multiple pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (PSP) patients. A total of 36 PSP patients with multiple tumor characteristics were identified from the literature search. They were compared with 43 solitary PSP patients diagnosed and treated in our hospital in the past 5 years. Thus, the pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, diagnosis methods, treatment strategies, and prognosis of pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma (PSP) patients with multiple tumors were explored. Patients with multiple PSP are mostly distributed in Asia (88.89%) and are females (83.33%). PSP can be located in any one lobe (19.44%), or grow across ipsilateral lobes (44.44%), or even, bilateral lobes (36.11%). It can be accompanied by metastasis (9.09%) and is prone to misdiagnosis (27.78%). Compared with solitary PSP, the occurrence age of multiple PSP was younger (mean ± standard deviation [SD]: 40.36 ± 18.12: 51.28 ± 12.74 years), but there was no significant difference in sex, tumor size (mean ± SD: 43.54 ± 46.18: 30.56 ± 17.62 mm), or symptoms. Individualized surgical resection is required for treatment, including pneumonectomy (17.65%), lobectomy (23.53%), subpulmonary lobectomy (38.24%), or combined lobectomy (5.88%). Multiple PSP is relatively rare. Surgical resection within a limited time should be the main treatment for such patients. The prognosis of patients with multiple PSP is generally good, but inappropriate diagnosis and treatment plans may lead to poor prognosis.","Pulmonary sclerosing pneumocytoma, Multiple tumor, Treatment and diagnosis"

We establish regionally derived models of GBM edge and core that retain their spatial identity in a cell autonomous manner. Upon xenotransplantation, edge-derived cells show a higher capacity for infiltrative growth, while core cells demonstrate core lesions with greater therapy resistance. Investigation of intercellular signaling between these two tumor populations uncovers the paracrine crosstalk from tumor core that promotes malignancy and therapy resistance of edge cells. These phenotypic alterations are initiated by HDAC1 in GBM core cells which subsequently affect edge cells by secreting the soluble form of CD109 protein. Our data reveal the role of intracellular communication between regionally different populations of GBM cells in tumor recurrence.",

Our data reveal that regional alterations in chromosome structure underlie clonal transcriptomic, epigenomic, and histopathologic signatures in meningioma. Stereotactic co-registration of sample coordinates to preoperative magnetic resonance images further suggest that high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) distinguishes meningioma regions with proliferating cells enriched for developmental gene expression programs. To understand the function of these genes in meningioma, we develop a human cerebral organoid model of meningioma and validate the high ADC marker genes CDH2 and PTPRZ1 as potential targets for meningioma therapy using live imaging, single cell RNA sequencing, CRISPR interference, and pharmacology.",
Aspartame carcinogenic potential revealed through network toxicology and molecular docking insights,"Dandan Chen, Xianbing Hou",2024-05-20,"The research employed network toxicology and molecular docking techniques to systematically examine the potential carcinogenic effects and mechanisms of aspartame (l-α-aspartyl-l-phenylalanine methyl ester). Aspartame, a commonly used synthetic sweetener, is widely applied in foods and beverages globally. In recent years, its safety issues, particularly the potential carcinogenic risk, have garnered widespread attention. The study first constructed an interaction network map of aspartame with gastric cancer targets using network toxicology methods and identified key targets and pathways. Preliminary validation was conducted through microarray data analysis and survival analysis, and molecular docking techniques were employed to further examine the binding affinity and modes of action of aspartame with key proteins. The findings suggest that aspartame has the potential to impact various cancer-related proteins, potentially raising the likelihood of cellular carcinogenesis by interfering with biomolecular function. Furthermore, the study found that the action patterns and pathways of aspartame-related targets are like the mechanisms of known carcinogenic pathways, further supporting the scientific hypothesis of its potential carcinogenicity. However, given the complexity of the in vivo environment, we also emphasize the necessity of validating these molecular-level findings in actual biological systems. The study introduces a fresh scientific method for evaluating the safety of food enhancers and provides a theoretical foundation for shaping public health regulations.","Network toxicology, Molecular docking, Sweetener, Aspartame, Carcinogenicity, Mechanism of action"

Before surgery, all patients underwent both plain and contrast-enhanced chest CT scans. Two clinical characteristics, fifteen plain CT characteristics, and four enhanced characteristics were used to develop two logistic regression models: model 1 (plain CT only) and model 2 (plain + contrast CT). The diagnostic performance of the two models was assessed separately in the development and external validation cohorts using the AUC. 392 patients from Center A were included in the training cohort (median size, 20.0 [IQR, 15.0–24.0] mm; mean age, 55.8 [SD, 9.9] years; male, 53.3%). 135 patients from Center B were included in the external validation cohort (median size, 20.0 [IQR, 16.0–24.0] mm; mean age, 56.4 [SD, 9.6] years; male, 51.9%).

Development of an individualized model for predicting postoperative delirium in elderly patients with hepatocellular carcinoma,"Mingfang Yan, Zhaoyan Lin, Huizhe Zheng, Jinglan Lai, Yuming Liu, Zhenmeng Lin",2024-05-22,"Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in older patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that adversely impacts clinical outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the risk factors for POD and to construct a predictive nomogram. Data for a total of 1481 older patients (training set: n=1109; validation set: n=372) who received liver resection for HCC were retrospectively retrieved from two prospective databases. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the performance. The rate of POD was 13.3% (148/1109) in the training set and 16.4% (61/372) in the validation set. Multivariate analysis of the training set revealed that factors including age, history of cerebrovascular disease, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, albumin level, and surgical approach had significant effects on POD. The area under the ROC curves (AUC) for the nomogram, incorporating the aforementioned predictors, was 0.798 (95% CI 0.752–0.843) and 0.808 (95% CI 0.754–0.861) for the training and validation sets, respectively. The calibration curves of both sets showed a degree of agreement between the nomogram and the actual probability. DCA demonstrated that the newly established nomogram was highly effective for clinical decision-making. We developed and validated a nomogram with high sensitivity to assist clinicians in estimating the individual risk of POD in older patients with HCC.",

The following study compares different RNA extraction and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) methods for mRNA detection in stool and identifies a robust and sensitive protocol. A combination of the Stool total RNA purification kit (Norgen) and the Superscript III one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) provided high RNA purity and sensitive and consistent mRNA detection, making them well-suited candidates for large-scale studies. We tested the protocol by detecting the mRNA of several immune genes (CXCL1, IL8, IL1B, IL6, PTGS2, and SPP1) in 22 CRCs, 24 adenomatous polyps, and 22 control stool samples. All these inflammatory markers, except for CXCL1, showed a strong association with CRC. Cancer stool samples showed increased levels of IL1B, IL8, and PTGS2 transcripts compared to polyp and control groups. Thus, this work supports the potential use of fecal mRNA as biomarkers for CRC detection.","Colorectal cancer, Non-invasive detection, Stool mRNA biomarkers, Diagnostic method"

Automatically learned computational histopathological features correlate with a large range of recurrent genetic aberrations across cancer types. This includes whole-genome duplications, which display universal features across cancer types, individual chromosomal aneuploidies, focal amplifications and deletions, as well as driver gene mutations. There are widespread associations between bulk gene expression levels and histopathology, which reflect tumor composition and enable the localization of transcriptomically defined tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Computational histopathology augments prognosis based on histopathological subtyping and grading, and highlights prognostically relevant areas such as necrosis or lymphocytic aggregates.

Whereas previous studies involved intratumoral injection, we report here an inhalable nanoparticle-immunotherapy system targeting pulmonary antigen presenting cells (APCs) to enhance anticancer immunity against lung metastases. Inhalation of phosphatidylserine coated liposome loaded with STING agonist cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (NP-cGAMP) in mouse models of lung metastases enables rapid distribution of NP-cGAMP to both lungs and subsequent uptake by APCs without causing immunopathology. NP-cGAMP designed for enhanced cytosolic release of cGAMP stimulates STING signaling and type I interferons production in APCs, resulting in the pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment in multifocal lung metastases. Furthermore, fractionated radiation delivered to one tumor-bearing lung synergizes with inhaled NP-cGAMP, eliciting systemic anticancer immunity, controlling metastases in both lungs, and conferring long-term survival in mice with lung metastases and with repeated tumor challenge.",
CD74 supports accumulation and function of regulatory T cells in tumors,"Elisa Bonnin, Maria Rodrigo Riestra, Federico Marziali, Rafael Mena Osuna, Jordan Denizeau, Mathieu Maurin, Juan Jose Saez, Mabel Jouve, Pierre-Emmanuel Bonté, Wilfrid Richer, Fabien Nevo, Sebastien Lemoine, Nicolas Girard, Marine Lefevre, Edith Borcoman, Anne Vincent-Salomon, Sylvain Baulande, Helene D. Moreau, Christine Sedlik, Claire Hivroz, Ana-Maria Lennon-Duménil, Jimena Tosello Boari, Eliane Piaggio",2024-05-03,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are plastic cells playing a pivotal role in the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Tregs actively adapt to the microenvironment where they reside; as a consequence, their molecular and functional profiles differ among tissues and pathologies. In tumors, the features acquired by Tregs remains poorly characterized. Here, we observe that human tumor-infiltrating Tregs selectively overexpress CD74, the MHC class II invariant chain. CD74 has been previously described as a regulator of antigen-presenting cell biology, however its function in Tregs remains unknown. CD74 genetic deletion in human primary Tregs reveals that CD74KO Tregs exhibit major defects in the organization of their actin cytoskeleton and intracellular organelles. Additionally, intratumoral CD74KO Tregs show a decreased activation, a drop in Foxp3 expression, a low accumulation in the tumor, and consistently, they are associated with accelerated tumor rejection in preclinical models in female mice. These observations are unique to tumor conditions as, at steady state, CD74KO-Treg phenotype, survival, and suppressive capacity are unaffected in vitro and in vivo. CD74 therefore emerges as a specific regulator of tumor-infiltrating Tregs and as a target to interfere with Treg anti-tumor activity.",
"Clear surgical margins as a prognostic indicator for disease recurrence, with no impact on survival rates in patients with myxofibrosarcoma","Tomáš Tomáš, Vasileios Apostolopoulos, Lukáš Pazourek, Marián Kubíček, Iva Staniczková Zambo, Dagmar Adámková, Pavel Šlampa, Michal Mahdal",2024-05-28,"Myxofibrosarcoma presents an infiltrating growth pattern that results in a high tendency for local recurrence. Clear margin resection is challenging because of microscopic infiltration. The purpose of the present study was to analyze the overall and disease-free survival rates of patients with myxofibrosarcoma and the prognostic factors that determine both survival and disease recurrence. Among the 111 patients included in our study, the 5-year overall survival rate was 65.5%. An age of more than 65 years (hazard ratio [HR] 1.9 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4–5.6]; p < 0.001), a tumor size of more than 5 cm (HR 2.8 [95% CI 0.9–8.1]; p = 0.049) and the G3 tumor grade (HR 14.1 [95% CI 2.1–105.0]; p < 0.001) negatively affected overall survival. The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 49.4%. R1/R2-type resection (HR 2.4 [95% CI 1.0–5.6]; p = 0.048) had a detrimental effect on tumor recurrence. Clear margins had a positive impact on recurrence-free survival, but did not significantly affect overall patient survival, suggesting that other factors may play a more significant role in determining patient outcomes. A surgical margin of 2 mm was not sufficient to significantly influence the incidence of recurrence. Consequently, a wider surgical margin may be necessary to reduce the risk of myxofibrosarcoma recurrence.",

To uncover mechanisms of resistance, we conducted a detailed, longitudinal analysis of tumor and plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) among such patients from a phase I/II trial combining alpelisib with an aromatase inhibitor (NCT01870505). The trial’s primary objective was to establish safety with maculopapular rash emerging as the most common grade 3 adverse event (33%). Among 44 evaluable patients, the observed clinical benefit rate was 52%. Correlating genetic alterations with outcome, we identified loss-of-function PTEN mutations in 25% of patients with resistance. ESR1 activating mutations also expanded in number and allele fraction during treatment and were associated with resistance. These data indicate that genomic alterations that mediate resistance to alpelisib or antiestrogen may promote disease progression and highlight PTEN loss as a recurrent mechanism of resistance to PI3Kα inhibition.",
Auxiliary effect of trolox on coenzyme Q10 restricts angiogenesis and proliferation of retinoblastoma cells via the ERK/Akt pathway,"Shikha Upreti, Prachi Sharma, Seema Sen, Subhrajit Biswas, Madhumita P. Ghosh",2024-11-09,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential for cancer signalling pathways and tumour maintenance, making ROS targeting a promising anti-cancer strategy. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has been shown to be effective against various cancers, but its impact on retinoblastoma, alone or with trolox, remains unreported. Cytotoxicity of CoQ10 alone and with trolox was evaluated in normal human retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) and Y79 retinoblastoma cells using CCK-8. Flow cytometry was used to assess apoptosis, cell cycle, ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Anti-angiogenic potential was tested using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. Mechanistic studies were conducted via RT-PCR and western blotting. CoQ10, alone and with trolox, reduced Y79 cell viability, induced apoptosis through excess ROS generation, and decreased MMP significantly. Both treatments caused G2/M phase cell arrest. The CAM assay showed a significant reduction in endothelial cell proliferation, evidenced by fewer number of co-cultured HUVECs when exposed to CoQ10 or CoQ10 with trolox. The combination of CoQ10 and trolox significantly reduced VEGF-A, ERK, and Akt receptor levels, while CoQ10 alone significantly inhibited ERK and Akt phosphorylation. Together, CoQ10 and trolox reduced protein expression of VEGFA. CoQ10 alone and with trolox, induces apoptosis in Y79 retinoblastoma cells by inhibiting the ERK/Akt pathway and downregulating VEGFA. This study is the first to report the in vitro and in-ovo anti-cancer potential of CoQ10 alone or when combined with trolox, on human retinoblastoma Y79 cells.","Rb cells, CoQ10, Trolox, Anti-cancer, ERK/Akt inhibition"
Stroke among cancer patients,"Nicholas G. Zaorsky, Ying Zhang, Leila T. Tchelebi, Heath B. Mackley, Vernon M. Chinchilli, Brad E.

This is a population-based study using nationally representative data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, 1992-2015. Among 7,529,481 cancer patients, 80,513 died of fatal stroke (with 262,461 person-years at risk); the rate of fatal stroke was 21.64 per 100,000-person years, and the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of fatal stroke was 2.17 (95% CI, 2.15, 2.19). Patients with cancer of the prostate, breast, and colorectum contribute to the plurality of cancer patients dying of fatal stroke. Brain and gastrointestinal cancer patients had the highest SMRs (>2-5) through the follow up period. Among those diagnosed at <40 years of age, the plurality of strokes occurs in patients treated for brain tumors and lymphomas; if >40, from cancers of the prostate, breast, and colorectum.

Schmid",2024-04-27,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly metastatic disease for which better therapies are urgently needed. Fibroblasts and macrophages are heterogeneous cell populations able to enhance metastasis, but the role of a macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk in regulating their pro-metastatic functions remains poorly understood. Here we deconvolve how macrophages regulate metastasis-associated fibroblast (MAF) heterogeneity in the liver. We identify three functionally distinct MAF populations, among which the generation of pro-metastatic and immunoregulatory myofibroblastic-MAFs (myMAFs) critically depends on macrophages. Mechanistically, myMAFs are induced through a STAT3-dependent mechanism driven by macrophage-derived progranulin and cancer cell-secreted leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In a reciprocal manner, myMAF secreted osteopontin promotes an immunosuppressive macrophage phenotype resulting in the inhibition of cytotoxic T cell functions. Pharmacological blockade of STAT3 or myMAF-specific genetic depletion of STAT3 restores an anti-tumour immune response and reduces metastases. Our findings provide molecular insights into the complex macrophage–fibroblast interactions in tumours and reveal potential targets to inhibit PDAC liver metastasis.",

However, increased activity of metabolic enzymes is not usually considered an initiating event in the malignant process. Here, we investigate the possible role of the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase-2 (SHMT2) in lymphoma initiation. SHMT2 localizes to the most frequent region of copy number gains at chromosome 12q14.1 in lymphoma. Elevated expression of SHMT2 cooperates with BCL2 in lymphoma development; loss or inhibition of SHMT2 impairs lymphoma cell survival. SHMT2 catalyzes the conversion of serine to glycine and produces an activated one-carbon unit that can be used to support S-adenosyl methionine synthesis. SHMT2 induces changes in DNA and histone methylation patterns leading to promoter silencing of previously uncharacterized mutational genes, such as SASH1 and PTPRM. Together, our findings reveal that amplification of SHMT2 in cooperation with BCL2 is sufficient in the initiation of lymphomagenesis through epigenetic tumor suppressor silencing.",

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from patients with high PCa volume is sufficient to stimulate the growth of mouse PCa revealing the existence of a gut microbiome-cancer crosstalk. Analysis of gut microbial-related pathways in mice with aggressive PCa identifies three enzymes responsible for the metabolism of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). Supplementation with LCFA omega-3 MAG-EPA is sufficient to reduce PCa growth in mice and cancer up-grading in pre-prostatectomy PCa patients correlating with a reduction of gut Ruminococcaceae in both and fecal butyrate levels in PCa patients. This suggests that the beneficial effect of omega-3 rich diet is mediated in part by modulating the crosstalk between gut microbes and their metabolites in men with PCa.",

Three patient-derived PDACs were transplanted into the livers of 21 rats each (totally, 63 rats), randomly assigned into hepatic arterial infusion, systemic venous infusion, and control groups (n = 7 each) four weeks post-implantation. Computed tomography evaluated tumor volumes before and four weeks after treatment. Post-euthanasia, resected tumor specimens underwent histopathological examination. A liver-implanted PDAC PDX rat model was established in all 63 rats, with first CT identifying all tumors. Four weeks post-treatment, arterial infusion groups exhibited significantly smaller tumor volumes than controls for all three tumors on second CT. Xenograft tumors histologically maintained adenocarcinoma features compared to original patient tumors. Ki67 expression was significantly lower in arterial infusion groups than in the other two for the three tumors, indicating reduced tumor growth in PDX rats. A liver-implanted PDAC PDX rat model was established as a rat-based preclinical platform.

Establishment of a prognostic nomogram for elderly patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer receiving radiotherapy,"Lixia Zhang, Qingfen Zhang, Qian Wu, Lujun Zhao, Yunbin Gao, Xue Li, Song Guan, Meng Yan",2024-05-25,"The present study explored the risk factors associated with radiotherapy in seniors diagnosed with limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) to construct and validate a prognostic nomogram. The study retrospectively included 137 elderly patients with LS-SCLC who previously received radiotherapy. Univariate and multivariate COX analyses were conducted to identify independent risk factors and determine optimal cut-off values. Kaplan–Meier survival curves and nomograms were constructed to predict survival. Calibration and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the accuracy and consistency of the nomogram. Illness rating scale-geriatric (CIRS-G) score, treatment strategy, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), white blood cell-to-monocyte ratio (WMR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) were discovered to be independent prognostic factors. Based on the findings of our multivariate analysis, a risk nomogram was developed to assess patient prognosis. Internal bootstrap resampling was utilized to validate the model, and while the accuracy of the AUC curve at 1 year was modest at 0.657 (95% CI 0.458–0.856), good results were achieved in predicting 3- and 5 year survival with AUCs of 0.757 (95% CI 0.670–0.843) and 0.768 (95% CI 0.643–0.893), respectively. Calibration curves for 1-, 3-, and 5 year overall survival probabilities demonstrated good cocsistency between expected and actual outcomes. Patients with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, CIRS-G score > 5 points and low PNI, WMR and LMR correlated with poor prognosis. The nomogram model developed based on these factors demonstrated good predictive performance and provides a simple, accessible, and practical tool for clinicians to guide clinical decision-making and study design.","Elderly patients, Limited-stage small cell lung cancer, Nomogram, Survival prediction"
TGFβ2-induced formation of lipid droplets supports acidosis-driven EMT and the metastatic spreading of cancer cells,"Cyril Corbet, Estelle Bastien, Joao Pedro Santiago de Jesus, Emeline Dierge, Ruben Martherus, Catherine Vander Linden, Bastien Doix, Charline Degavre, Céline Guilbaud, Laurenne Petit, Carine Michiels, Chantal Dessy, Yvan Larondelle, Olivier Feron",2020-01-23,"Acidosis, a common characteristic of the tumor microenvironment, is associated with alterations in metabolic preferences of cancer cells and progression of the disease. Here we identify the TGF-β2 isoform at the interface between these observations. We document that acidic pH promotes autocrine TGF-β2 signaling, which in turn favors the formation of lipid droplets (LD) that represent energy stores readily available to support anoikis resistance and cancer cell invasiveness. We find that, in cancer cells of various origins, acidosis-induced TGF-β2 activation promotes both partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fatty acid metabolism, the latter supporting Smad2 acetylation. We show that upon TGF-β2 stimulation, PKC-zeta-mediated translocation of CD36 facilitates the uptake of fatty acids that are either stored as triglycerides in LD through DGAT1 or oxidized to generate ATP to fulfill immediate cellular needs. We also address how, by preventing fatty acid mobilization from LD, distant metastatic spreading may be inhibited.",

Three-dimensional volumes of interest were segmented from 424 cases of glioma imaging data retrospectively obtained from two medical centers using the segmentation method and radiomic features were extracted. We developed a subtype prediction model based on extracted radiomic features and analyzed significance and correlations between glioma morphological characteristics and pathological features using data from patients with adult-type diffuse glioma. The automated segmentation achieved mean Dice scores of 0.884 and 0.889 for the tumor core and whole tumor, respectively.

However, the overall response rate to ICB therapy remains low in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This study aimed to identify biomarkers of ICB therapy for ESCC and interrogate its potential clinical relevance.MethodsWe investigated gene expression in 42 treatment-naïve ESCC tumor tissues and identified differentially expressed genes, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immune-related genes signatures associated with differential immunotherapy responses. We systematically assessed the tumor microenvironment using the NanoString GeoMx digital spatial profiler, single-cell RNA-seq and multiplex immunohistochemistry in ESCC. Finally, we evaluated the associations between HLA-A-positive tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) and patients’ responses to ICB in 60 ESCC patients.ResultsTumor infiltrating B lymphocytes and several immune-related gene signatures, such as the antigen presenting machinery (APM) signature, are significantly elevated in ICB treatment responders. Multiplex immunohistochemistry identified the presence of HLA-A+ TLSs and showed that TLS-resident cells increasingly express HLA-A as TLSs mature. Most TLS-resident HLA-A+ cells are tumor-infiltrating T (TIL-T) or tumor-infiltrating B (TIL-B) lymphocytes. Digital spatial profiling of spatially distinct TIL-T lymphocytes and single-cell RNA-seq data from 60 ESCC tumor tissues revealed that CXCL13-expressing exhausted TIL-Ts inside TLSs are reactivated with elevated expression of the APM signature as TLSs mature. Finally, we demonstrated that HLA-A+ TLSs and their major cellular components, TIL-Ts and TIL-Bs, are associated with a clinical benefit from ICB treatment for ESCC.ConclusionsHLA-A+ TLSs are present in ESCC tumor tissues. TLS-resident TIL-Ts with elevated expression of the APM signature may be reactivated. HLA-A+ TLSs and their major cellular components, TIL-Ts and TIL-Bs, may serve as biomarkers for ICB-treated ESCC patients.",

BMP7 secreted by tumor cells acts on macrophages and CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment, inhibiting MAPK14 expression and impairing pro-inflammatory responses. Knockdown of BMP7 or its neutralization via follistatin in combination with anti-PD1 re-sensitizes resistant tumors to immunotherapies.

We assessed the impact of AmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs on cellular functions and signaling pathways, and investigated the effects of Pcdha11 deficiency in mice.ResultsAmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs significantly reduced the proliferation of gastric cancer cells and other solid tumors, whereas overexpression of PCDHA11 enhanced cell proliferation. The selected ASOs inhibited cellular functions related to the metastatic potential of gastric cancer cells, including migration, invasiveness, spheroid formation, and cancer stemness. Our findings revealed that AmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs disrupted the AKT/mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. In mouse models of peritoneal metastasis (gastric and pancreatic cancer), systemic metastasis, and established subcutaneous tumors, administration of AmNA-modified anti-PCDHA11 ASOs inhibited tumor growth. ASO treatment induced reversible, dose- and sequence-dependent liver damage.

Here, we describe the generation of clonal populations from a patient-derived ovarian clear cell carcinoma model which forms malignant ascites and solid peritoneal tumors upon intraperitoneal transplantation in mice. The clonal populations are engineered with secreted Gaussia luciferase to monitor tumor growth dynamics and tagged with a unique DNA barcode to track their fate in multiclonal mixtures during tumor progression. Only one clone, CL31, grows robustly, generating exclusively malignant ascites. However, multiclonal mixtures form large solid peritoneal metastases, populated almost entirely by CL31, suggesting that transient cooperative interclonal interactions are sufficient to promote metastasis of CL31. CL31 uniquely harbors ERBB2 amplification, and its acquired metastatic activity in clonal mixtures is dependent on transient exposure to amphiregulin, which is exclusively secreted by non-tumorigenic clones. Amphiregulin enhances CL31 mesothelial clearance, a prerequisite for metastasis. These findings demonstrate that transient, ostensibly innocuous tumor subpopulations can promote metastases via “hit-and-run” commensal interactions.",

The effects of disrupting this pathway on T-cells are being actively explored and controversial outcomes have been reported. Here, we hypothesize that CAR-antigen affinity may be a key factor modulating T-cell susceptibility towards the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. We systematically interrogate CAR-T cells targeting HER2 with either low (LA) or high affinity (HA) in various preclinical models. Our results reveal an increased sensitivity of LA CAR-T cells to PD-L1-mediated inhibition when compared to their HA counterparts by using in vitro models of tumor cell lines and supported lipid bilayers modified to display varying PD-L1 densities. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout (KO) of PD-1 enhances LA CAR-T cell cytokine secretion and polyfunctionality in vitro and antitumor effect in vivo and results in the downregulation of gene signatures related to T-cell exhaustion. By contrast, HA CAR-T cell features remain unaffected following PD-1 KO. This behavior holds true for CD28 and ICOS but not 4-1BB co-stimulated CAR-T cells, which are less sensitive to PD-L1 inhibition albeit targeting the antigen with LA. Our findings may inform CAR-T therapies involving disruption of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway tailored in particular for effective treatment of solid tumors.",

Razak, Pamela S. Ohashi",2024-02-06,"Immunotherapies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 are now widely used in the clinic to treat a variety of malignancies. While most of the research on T cell exhaustion and PD-1 blockade has been focused on conventional αβ T cells, the contribution of innate-like T cells such as γδ T cells to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 mediated therapy is limited. Here we show that tumor reactive γδ T cells respond to PD-1 blockade in a Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) patient experiencing a complete response to therapy. We find clonally expanded γδ T cells in the blood and tumor after pembrolizumab treatment, and this Vγ2Vδ1 clonotype recognizes Merkel cancer cells in a TCR-dependent manner. Notably, the intra-tumoral γδ T cells in the MCC patient are characterized by higher expression of PD-1 and TIGIT, relative to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells. Our results demonstrate that innate-like T cells could also contribute to an anti-tumor response after PD-1 blockade.",
Redox-responsive polymer micelles co-encapsulating immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents for glioblastoma therapy,"Zhiqi Zhang, Xiaoxuan Xu, Jiawei Du, Xin Chen, Yonger Xue, Jianqiong Zhang, Xue Yang, Xiaoyuan Chen, Jinbing Xie, Shenghong Ju",2024-02-06,"Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) for glioblastoma (GBM) is promising but its clinical efficacy is seriously challenged by the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibodies (aPD-L1) are loaded into a redox-responsive micelle and the ICB efficacy is further amplified by paclitaxel (PTX)-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) via a co-encapsulation approach for the reinvigoration of local anti-GBM immune responses. Consequently, the micelles cross the BTB and are retained in the reductive tumor microenvironment without altering the bioactivity of aPD-L1. The ICB efficacy is enhanced by the aPD-L1 and PTX combination with suppression of primary and recurrent GBM, accumulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and induction of long-lasting immunological memory in the orthotopic GBM-bearing mice. The co-encapsulation approach facilitating efficient antibody delivery and combining with chemotherapeutic agent-induced ICD demonstrate that the chemo-immunotherapy might reprogram local immunity to empower immunotherapy against GBM.",
Targeting DNA2 overcomes metabolic reprogramming in multiple myeloma,"Natthakan Thongon, Feiyang Ma, Natalia Baran, Pamela Lockyer, Jintan Liu, Christopher Jackson, Ashley Rose, Ken Furudate, Bethany Wildeman, Matteo Marchesini, Valentina Marchica, Paola Storti, Giannalisa Todaro, Irene Ganan-Gomez, Vera Adema, Juan Jose Rodriguez-Sevilla, Yun Qing, Min Jin Ha, Rodrigo Fonseca, Caleb Stein, Caleb Class, Lin Tan, Sergio Attanasio, Guillermo Garcia-Manero, Nicola Giuliani, David Berrios Nolasco, Andrea Santoni, Claudio Cerchione, Carlos Bueso-Ramos, Marina Konopleva, Philip Lorenzi, Koichi Takahashi, Elisabet Manasanch, Gabriella Sammarelli, Rashmi Kanagal-Shamanna, Andrea Viale, Marta Chesi, Simona Colla",2024-02-08,"DNA damage resistance is a major barrier to effective DNA-damaging therapy in multiple myeloma (MM). To discover mechanisms through which MM cells overcome DNA damage, we investigate how MM cells become resistant to antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapy targeting Interleukin enhancer binding factor 2 (ILF2), a DNA damage regulator that is overexpressed in 70% of MM patients whose disease has progressed after standard therapies have failed. Here, we show that MM cells undergo adaptive metabolic rewiring to restore energy balance and promote survival in response to DNA damage activation. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 screening strategy, we identify the mitochondrial DNA repair protein DNA2, whose loss of function suppresses MM cells’ ability to overcome ILF2 ASO−induced DNA damage, as being essential to counteracting oxidative DNA damage. Our study reveals a mechanism of vulnerability of MM cells that have an increased demand for mitochondrial metabolism upon DNA damage activation.",
A wearable electrostimulation-augmented ionic-gel photothermal patch doped with MXene for skin tumor treatment,"Xingkai Ju, Jiao Kong, Guohua Qi, Shuping Hou, Xingkang Diao, Shaojun Dong, Yongdong Jin",2024-01-26,"A wearable biological patch capable of producing multiple responses to light and electricity without interfering with daily activities is highly desired for skin cancer treatment, but remains a key challenge. Herein, the skin-mountable electrostimulation-augmented photothermal patch (eT-patch) comprising transparent ionic gel with MXene (Ti3C2Tx) doping is developed and applied for the treatment of melanoma under photostimulation at 0.5 W/cm2. The eT-patch designed has superior photothermal and electrical characteristics owing to ionic gels doped with MXene which provides high photothermal conversion efficiency and electrical conductivity as a medium. Simultaneously, the ionic gel-based eT-patch having excellent optical transparency actualizes real-time observation of skin response and melanoma treatment process under photothermal and electrical stimulation (PES) co-therapy. Systematical cellular study on anti-tumor mechanism of the eT-patch under PES treatment revealed that eT-patch under PES treatment can synergically trigger cancer cell apoptosis and pyroptosis, which together lead to the death of melanoma cells. Due to the obvious advantages of relatively safe and less side effects in healthy organs, the developed eT-patch provides a promising cost-effective therapeutic strategy for skin tumors and will open a new avenue for biomedical applications of ionic gels.",
"Integrating leiomyoma genetics, epigenomics, and single-cell transcriptomics reveals causal genetic variants, genes, and cell types","Kadir Buyukcelebi, Alexander J. Duval, Fatih Abdula, Hoda Elkafas, Fidan Seker-Polat, Mazhar Adli",2024-02-07,"Uterine fibroids (UF), that can disrupt normal uterine function and cause significant physical and psychological health problems, are observed in nearly 70% of women of reproductive age. Although heritable genetics is a significant risk factor, specific genetic variations and gene targets causally associated with UF are poorly understood. Here, we performed a meta-analysis on existing fibroid genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and integrated the identified risk loci and potentially causal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with epigenomics, transcriptomics, 3D chromatin organization from diverse cell types as well as primary UF patient’s samples. This integrative analysis identifies 24 UF-associated risk loci that potentially target 394 genes, of which 168 are differentially expressed in UF tumors. Critically, integrating this data with single-cell gene expression data from UF patients reveales the causal cell types with aberrant expression of these target genes. Lastly, CRISPR-based epigenetic repression (dCas9-KRAB) or activation (dCas9-p300) in a UF disease-relevant cell type further refines and narrows down the potential gene targets. Our findings and the methodological approach indicate the effectiveness of integrating multi-omics data with locus-specific epigenetic editing approaches for identifying gene- and celt type-targets of disease-relevant risk loci.",
Inhibition of ADAM9 promotes the selective degradation of KRAS and sensitizes pancreatic cancers to chemotherapy,"Yu-Kai Huang, Wei-Chung Cheng, Ting-Ting Kuo, Juan-Cheng Yang, Yang-Chang Wu, Heng-Hsiung Wu, Chia-Chien Lo, Chih-Ying Hsieh, Sze-Ching Wong, Chih-Hao Lu, Wan-Ling Wu, Shih-Jen Liu, Yi-Chuan Li, Ching-Chan Lin, Chia-Ning Shen, Mien-Chie Hung, Jaw-Town Lin, Chun-Chieh Yeh, Yuh-Pyng Sher",2024-01-24,"Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) signaling drives pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) malignancy, which is an unmet clinical need. Here, we identify a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAM)9 as a modulator of PDAC progression via stabilization of wild-type and mutant KRAS proteins. Mechanistically, ADAM9 loss increases the interaction of KRAS with plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which functions as a selective autophagy receptor in conjunction with light chain 3 (LC3), triggering lysosomal degradation of KRAS. Suppression of ADAM9 by a small-molecule inhibitor restricts disease progression in spontaneous models, and combination with gemcitabine elicits dramatic regression of patient-derived tumors. Our findings provide a promising strategy to target the KRAS signaling cascade and demonstrate a potential modality to enhance sensitivity to chemotherapy in PDAC.",
Durvalumab plus pazopanib combination in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcomas: a phase II trial,"Hee Jin Cho, Kum-Hee Yun, Su-Jin Shin, Young Han Lee, Seung Hyun Kim, Wooyeol Baek, Yoon Dae Han, Sang Kyum Kim, Hyang Joo Ryu, Joohee Lee, Iksung Cho, Heounjeong Go, Jiwon Ko, Inkyung Jung, Min Kyung Jeon, Sun Young Rha, Hyo Song Kim",2024-01-23,"We aimed to determine the activity of the anti-VEGF receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, pazopanib, combined with the anti-PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab, in metastatic and/or recurrent soft tissue sarcoma (STS). In this single-arm phase 2 trial (NCT03798106), treatment consisted of pazopanib 800 mg orally once a day and durvalumab 1500 mg once every 3 weeks. Primary outcome was overall response rate (ORR) and secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, disease control rate, immune-related response criteria, and safety. The ORR was 30.4% and the trial met the pre-specified endpoint. The median PFS was 7.7 months (95% confidence interval: 5.7–10.4). The common treatment-related adverse events of grades 3–4 included neutropenia (9 [19.1%]), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (7 [14.9%]), alanine aminotransferase (5 [10.6%]), and thrombocytopenia (4 [8.5%]). In a prespecified transcriptomic analysis, the B lineage signature was a significant key determinant of overall response (P = 0.014). In situ analysis also showed that tumours with high CD20+ B cell infiltration and vessel density had a longer PFS (P = 6.5 × 10−4) than those with low B cell infiltration and vessel density, as well as better response (50% vs 12%, P = 0.019). CD20+ B cell infiltration was identified as the only independent predictor of PFS via multivariate analysis. Durvalumab combined with pazopanib demonstrated promising efficacy in an unselected STS cohort, with a manageable toxicity profile.",
Targeting ALK averts ribonuclease 1-induced immunosuppression and enhances antitumor immunity in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Chunxiao Liu, Chenhao Zhou, Weiya Xia, Yifan Zhou, Yufan Qiu, Jialei Weng, Qiang Zhou, Wanyong Chen, Ying-Nai Wang, Heng-Huan Lee, Shao-Chun Wang, Ming Kuang, Dihua Yu, Ning Ren, Mien-Chie Hung",2024-02-02,"Tumor-secreted factors contribute to the development of a microenvironment that facilitates the escape of cancer cells from immunotherapy. In this study, we conduct a retrospective comparison of the proteins secreted by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in responders and non-responders among a cohort of ten patients who received Nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody). Our findings indicate that non-responders have a high abundance of secreted RNase1, which is associated with a poor prognosis in various cancer types. Furthermore, mice implanted with HCC cells that overexpress RNase1 exhibit immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and diminished response to anti-PD-1 therapy. RNase1 induces the polarization of macrophages towards a tumor growth-promoting phenotype through activation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) signaling pathway. Targeting the RNase1/ALK axis reprograms the macrophage polarization, with increased CD8+ T- and Th1- cell recruitment. Moreover, simultaneous targeting of the checkpoint protein PD-1 unleashes cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses. Treatment utilizing both an ALK inhibitor and an anti-PD-1 antibody exhibits enhanced tumor regression and facilitates long-term immunity. Our study elucidates the role of RNase1 in mediating tumor resistance to immunotherapy and reveals an RNase1-mediated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, highlighting the potential of targeting RNase1 as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy in HCC.",
Mutation-specific CAR T cells as precision therapy for IGLV3-21R110 expressing high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"Florian Märkl, Christoph Schultheiß, Murtaza Ali, Shih-Shih Chen, Marina Zintchenko, Lukas Egli, Juliane Mietz, Obinna Chijioke, Lisa Paschold, Sebastijan Spajic, Anne Holtermann, Janina Dörr, Sophia Stock, Andreas Zingg, Heinz Läubli, Ignazio Piseddu, David Anz, Marcus Dühren-von Minden, Tianjiao Zhang, Thomas Nerreter, Michael Hudecek, Susana Minguet, Nicholas Chiorazzi, Sebastian Kobold, Mascha Binder",2024-02-02,"The concept of precision cell therapy targeting tumor-specific mutations is appealing but requires surface-exposed neoepitopes, which is a rarity in cancer. B cell receptors (BCR) of mature lymphoid malignancies are exceptional in that they harbor tumor-specific-stereotyped sequences in the form of point mutations that drive self-engagement of the BCR and autologous signaling. Here, we use a BCR light chain neoepitope defined by a characteristic point mutation (IGLV3-21R110) for selective targeting of a poor-risk subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. We develop murine and humanized CAR constructs expressed in T cells from healthy donors and CLL patients that eradicate IGLV3-21R110 expressing cell lines and primary CLL cells, but neither cells expressing the non-pathogenic IGLV3-21G110 light chain nor polyclonal healthy B cells. In vivo experiments confirm epitope-selective cytolysis in xenograft models in female mice using engrafted IGLV3-21R110 expressing cell lines or primary CLL cells. We further demonstrate in two humanized mouse models lack of cytotoxicity towards human B cells. These data provide the basis for advanced approaches of resistance-preventive and biomarker-guided cellular targeting of functionally relevant lymphoma driver mutations sparing normal B cells.",
A novel approach to microsurgical teaching in head and neck surgery leveraging modern 3D technologies,"Manuel Weber, Joy Backhaus, Rainer Lutz, Christopher-Philipp Nobis, Samuel Zeichner, Sarah Koenig, Marco Kesting, Manuel Olmos",2023-11-20,"The anatomically complex and often spatially restricted conditions of anastomosis in the head and neck region cannot be adequately reproduced by training exercises on current ex vivo or small animal models. With the development of a Realistic Anatomical Condition Experience (RACE) model, complex spatial-anatomical surgical areas and the associated intraoperative complexities could be transferred into a realistic training situation in head and neck surgery. The RACE model is based on a stereolithography file generated by intraoperative use of a three-dimensional surface scanner after neck dissection and before microvascular anastomosis. Modelling of the acquired STL file using three-dimensional processing software led to the model’s final design. As a result, we have successfully created an economical, sustainable and realistic model for microsurgical education and provide a step-by-step workflow that can be used in surgical and general medical education to replicate and establish comparable models. We provide an open source stereolithography file of the head-and-neck RACE model for printing for educational purposes. Once implemented in other fields of surgery and general medicine, RACE models could mark a shift in medical education as a whole, away from traditional teaching principles and towards the use of realistic and individualised simulators.",
Clinicopathologic features and prognostic value of claudin 18.2 overexpression in patients with resectable gastric cancer,"Hyung-Don Kim, Eugene Choi, Jinho Shin, In-Seob Lee, Chang Seok Ko, Min-Hee Ryu, Young Soo Park",2023-11-16,"Claudin 18.2 has emerged as a promising therapeutic target in gastric cancer based on phase 3 studies. However, clinicopathologic features associated with claudin 18.2 overexpression have not been comprehensively studied specifically for patients with resectable gastric cancer. This retrospective study included 299 patients with stage I–III resectable gastric cancer who underwent curative surgical resection. Possible associations between claudin 18.2 overexpression (moderate-to-strong expression in ≥ 75% by the 43-14A clone) and clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes were analyzed. There were 90 (30.1%), 96 (32.1%), and 113 (37.8%) patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively. Claudin 18.2 overexpression was noted in 139 out of 299 patients (46.5%). Claudin 18.2 overexpression was associated with a younger age, a lower invasion depth limited to the mucosa/submucosa, and less frequent lymphovascular invasion. Claudin 18.2 overexpression was also associated with Borrmann type 4 among patients with advanced gastric cancer and the diffuse histological type. Claudin 18.2 overexpression was not an independent factor for survival outcomes. In conclusion, claudin 18.2 was overexpressed in almost half of resectable gastric cancer patients. Claudin 18.2 overexpression was associated with some clinicopathological characteristics, but was not an independent prognostic factor in a localized setting.",
CDC7 inhibition impairs neuroendocrine transformation in lung and prostate tumors through MYC degradation,"Alvaro Quintanal-Villalonga, Kenta Kawasaki, Esther Redin, Fathema Uddin, Swanand Rakhade, Vidushi Durani, Amin Sabet, Moniquetta Shafer, Wouter R.

Chan, Charles M. Rudin",2024-07-26,"Neuroendocrine (NE) transformation is a mechanism of resistance to targeted therapy in lung and prostate adenocarcinomas leading to poor prognosis. Up to date, even if patients at high risk of transformation can be identified by the occurrence of Tumor Protein P53 (TP53) and Retinoblastoma Transcriptional Corepressor 1 (RB1) mutations in their tumors, no therapeutic strategies are available to prevent or delay histological transformation. Upregulation of the cell cycle kinase Cell Division Cycle 7 (CDC7) occurred in tumors during the initial steps of NE transformation, already after TP53/RB1 co-inactivation, leading to induced sensitivity to the CDC7 inhibitor simurosertib. CDC7 inhibition suppressed NE transdifferentiation and extended response to targeted therapy in in vivo models of NE transformation by inducing the proteasome-mediated degradation of the MYC Proto-Oncogen (MYC), implicated in stemness and histological transformation. Ectopic overexpression of a degradation-resistant MYC isoform reestablished the NE transformation phenotype observed on targeted therapy, even in the presence of simurosertib. CDC7 inhibition also markedly extended response to standard cytotoxics (cisplatin, irinotecan) in lung and prostate small cell carcinoma models. These results nominate CDC7 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to constrain lineage plasticity, as well as to effectively treat NE tumors de novo or after transformation. As simurosertib clinical efficacy trials are ongoing, this concept could be readily translated for patients at risk of transformation.",
Systematic review: predictive value of organoids in colorectal cancer,"B. Cristoffer Sakshaug, Evelina Folkesson, Tonje Husby Haukaas, Torkild Visnes, Åsmund Flobak",2023-10-23,"While chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiotherapy and surgery are important modalities in the treatment of colorectal cancer, their widespread use is not paired with an abundance of diagnostic tools to match individual patients with the most effective standard-of-care chemo- or radiotherapy regimens. Patient-derived organoids are tumour-derived structures that have been shown to retain certain aspects of the tissue of origin. We present here a systematic review of studies that have tested the performance of patient derived organoids to predict the effect of anti-cancer therapies in colorectal cancer, for chemotherapies, targeted drugs, and radiation therapy, and we found overall a positive predictive value of 68% and a negative predictive value of 78% for organoid informed treatment, which outperforms response rates observed with empirically guided treatment selection.",
Radiotheranostics in oncology: current challenges and emerging opportunities,"Lisa Bodei, Ken Herrmann, Heiko Schöder, Andrew M. Scott, Jason S. Lewis",2022-06-20,"Structural imaging remains an essential component of diagnosis, staging and response assessment in patients with cancer; however, as clinicians increasingly seek to noninvasively investigate tumour phenotypes and evaluate functional and molecular responses to therapy, theranostics — the combination of diagnostic imaging with targeted therapy — is becoming more widely implemented. The field of radiotheranostics, which is the focus of this Review, combines molecular imaging (primarily PET and SPECT) with targeted radionuclide therapy, which involves the use of small molecules, peptides and/or antibodies as carriers for therapeutic radionuclides, typically those emitting α-, β- or auger-radiation. The exponential, global expansion of radiotheranostics in oncology stems from its potential to target and eliminate tumour cells with minimal adverse effects, owing to a mechanism of action that differs distinctly from that of most other systemic therapies. Currently, an enormous opportunity exists to expand the number of patients who can benefit from this technology, to address the urgent needs of many thousands of patients across the world. In this Review, we describe the clinical experience with established radiotheranostics as well as novel areas of research and various barriers to progress.",
Targeting chromosomal instability in patients with cancer,"Duaa H. Al-Rawi, Emanuele Lettera, Jun Li, Melody DiBona, Samuel F. Bakhoum",2024-07-11,"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer and a driver of metastatic dissemination, therapeutic resistance, and immune evasion. CIN is present in 60–80% of human cancers and poses a formidable therapeutic challenge as evidenced by the lack of clinically approved drugs that directly target CIN. This limitation in part reflects a lack of well-defined druggable targets as well as a dearth of tractable biomarkers enabling direct assessment and quantification of CIN in patients with cancer. Over the past decade, however, our understanding of the cellular mechanisms and consequences of CIN has greatly expanded, revealing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chromosomally unstable tumours as well as new methods of assessing the dynamic nature of chromosome segregation errors that define CIN. In this Review, we describe advances that have shaped our understanding of CIN from a translational perspective, highlighting both challenges and opportunities in the development of therapeutic interventions for patients with chromosomally unstable cancers.",

These biomarkers show potential as indicators for detecting both pre-cancerous and cancerous states within the oral cavity. Analyzing these specific molecules in saliva could help clinicians enhance diagnostic accuracy and refine early detection methods for OSCC. The research encompassed a cohort of nine OSCC patients, ten with oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), eleven individuals with oral lichen planus (OLP), and ten healthy controls. The study focused on assessing the expression levels of key biomarkers—IL-1β, IL-8, SAT, S100P, and OAZ1 mRNA—in extracellular RNA extracted from saliva samples. This evaluation was conducted using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) with sequence-specific primers. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve analysis was employed to gauge the efficacy of these biomarkers in detecting OSCC. Based on the results we observe, when these five biomarkers are used together, they give a 90% predictive probability for patients with OLP, an 80% predictive probability for OSF, and an impressive 100% predictive probability for patients with OSCC (AUC = 1.000, p = 0.000). This study demonstrates the efficacy of salivary transcriptome diagnostics in detecting OSCC. This novel clinical technique has the potential to be a powerful, efficient, and reliable tool for early detection of cancer. Salivary transcriptomes can be further analyzed to evaluate their effectiveness in other important illness contexts and for regular health monitoring.","Salivary biomarkers, Oral cancer, mRNA, Saliva, Precancer"

ZBTB18 regulates cytokine expression and affects microglia/macrophage recruitment and commitment in glioblastoma,"Roberto Ferrarese, Kevin Joseph, Geoffroy Andrieux, Ira Verena Haase, Francesca Zanon, Eva Kling, Annalisa Izzo, Eyleen Corrales, Marius Schwabenland, Marco Prinz, Vidhya Madapusi Ravi, Melanie Boerries, Dieter Henrik Heiland, Maria Stella Carro",2024-11-08,"Glioma associated macrophages/microglia (GAMs) play an important role in glioblastoma (GBM) progression, due to their massive recruitment to the tumor site and polarization to a tumor promoting phenotype. GAMs secrete a variety of cytokines, which facilitate tumor cell growth and invasion, and prevent other immune cells from mounting an immune response against the tumor. Here, we demonstrate that zinc finger and BTB containing domain 18 (ZBTB18), a transcriptional repressor with tumor suppressive function in glioblastoma, impairs the production of key cytokines, which function as chemoattractant for GAMs. Consistently, we observe a reduced migration of GAMs when ZBTB18 is expressed by glioblastoma cells, both in cell culture and in vivo experiments. Moreover, RNA sequencing analysis shows that the presence of ZBTB18 in glioblastoma cells alters the commitment of conditioned microglia, suggesting the loss of the immune-suppressive phenotype and the acquisition of pro-inflammatory features. Thus, therapeutic approaches to increase ZBTB18 expression in GBM cells could represent an effective adjuvant to immune therapy in GBM.",
"Epidemiology of malignant brain tumors in Genova, Italy. 1993–2017","Guido Frosina, Claudia Casella, Antonella Puppo, Enza Marani, Dalila Campanella, Luca Boni, Vincenzo Fontana",2024-11-08,"We present an updated analysis on the incidence of primary brain tumors in the Metropolitan Area of Genova, the capital of the northwestern Italian region Liguria.The number of cases and incidence rates for all malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma, malignant brain tumors other than glioblastoma, and brain tumors not otherwise specified were calculated for each of seven three-year and one-eighth four-year periods in which the quarter century 1993–2017 was divided. The rates were age-adjusted (AAR) using the 2013 European standard population, presented per 100,000 person-years and the average percentage change over the three-year period was calculated.The number of cases of all malignant brain tumors and glioblastoma was higher in males than in females in each three-year period and in the entire quarter century 1993–2017. During the latter, the average three-year percentage change in AARs for all brain tumors was minimal [0.6 (95% C.I. = -1.0/2.1) %] while for glioblastoma there was a change of 5.3 (95% C.I. = -0.4/11.3) %. The partially concurrent decline in the incidence rates of malignant brain tumors other than glioblastoma or not otherwise specified suggests that the observed increase in the incidence rate of glioblastoma during 1993–2017 may have been at least partially linked to the improvement during the same period in sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of glioblastoma, depleting the reservoirs of other malignant or unspecified brain tumors. Research into possibly increased environmental risk factors (e.g., population exposure to ionizing radiation) for glioblastoma in Genova remains warranted.","Brain cancer, Incidence, Age-adjusted rate, Glioblastoma, Glioma, Non-otherwise specified"

The normal bronchial organoids maintain cellular components of normal bronchial mucosa. Lung cancer organoids respond to drugs based on their genomic alterations: a BRCA2-mutant organoid to olaparib, an EGFR-mutant organoid to erlotinib, and an EGFR-mutant/MET-amplified organoid to crizotinib.

This study proposes a novel compensatory approach for delivering the required neutron fluence and validates its clinical applicability. The proposed approach relies on the neutron flux model and the cumulative sum of real-time measurements of proton charges. The accuracy of delivering the required neutron fluence for BNCT using the proposed approach was examined in five Li targets. With the proposed approach, the required neutron fluence could be delivered within 3.0%, and within 1.0% in most cases. However, those without using the proposed approach exceeded 3.0% in some cases. The proposed approach can consider the neutron flux reduction adequately and decrease the effect of uncertainty in neutron measurements. Therefore, the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of delivering the required fluence for BNCT even if a neutron flux reduction is expected during treatment and over the lifetime of the Li target. Additionally, by adequately revising the approach, it may apply to other type of BNCT systems employing a Li target, furthering research in this direction.","Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), Accelerator-based BNCT, Neutron fluence, Li target"

Hoechst 33,342 staining and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were employed to detect cell morphological changes and apoptosis, respectively. The MDA-MB-231/DOX models of transplanted tumor were established in BALB/c. The impact of LIPUS-MB on allograft tumor growth was observed in vivo. Immunohistochemistry was employed to investigate the expression of P-gp, ABCG2, and Ki-67 in tumor tissues, while western blot was utilized to assess the protein expression of P-gp, ABCG2, JNK, p-JNK, c-Jun, p-c-Jun, Bcl-2 and Bax in both MDA-MB-231/DOX cells and allograft tumor tissues. The optimal LIPUS-MB parameters for MDA-MB-231/DOX cells are the microbubble concentration of 20%, ultrasound intensity of 1.0 W/cm2, and irradiation time of 60 s. The drug resistance index of MDA-MB-231/DOX cells is 19.17. Following the optimal parameter application, the IC50 value of the cells decreases by 5.71-fold, with a reversal efficiency of 87.03%, and a simultaneous decrease in cell proliferation activity. Compared with other groups, the DOX + LIPUS-MB group displayed the highest incidence of apoptotic nuclear morphology, and the greatest quantity of cellular apoptosis and the most pronounced decrease in the expression levels of P-gp, ABCG2, p-JNK, p-c-Jun, and Bcl-2 proteins within the cells. Conversely, the expression levels of Bax proteins reach the highest levels (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, in vivo subcutaneous tumor transplantation experiments in nude mice revealed that the DOX + LIPUS-MB group exhibited smaller tumor growth rate, volume and the expression of P-gp, ABCG2, and Ki-67 compared to the DOX + LIPUS group, indicating the most pronounced inhibitory effect on tumor growth and it significantly inhibited tumor proliferation, promoted its apoptosis. In conclusion, following parameter optimization, LIPUS-MB was found to reduce the drug resistance of MDA-MB-231/DOX cells. The underlying mechanism may involve the downregulation of P-gp and ABCG2 proteins expression through the modulation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway by LIPUS-MB, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation activity and promoting apoptosis, and enhancing the in vivo anti-tumor effect of DOX, thus reversing multidrug resistance in triple-negative breast cancer.","Low-intensity pulse ultrasound, Microbubbles, Triple-negative breast cancer, Multidrug resistance, Doxorubicin, JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway"
"ANXA2 is correlated with the molecular features and clinical prognosis of glioma, and acts as a potential marker of immunosuppression","Kaiming Ma, Xin Chen, Weihai Liu, Yang Yang, Suhua Chen, Jianjun Sun, Changcheng Ma, Tao Wang, Jun Yang",2021-10-21,"Recent studies have shown that ANXA2 is important in the development of many cancers, while its role in glioma-related immune response remains unclear. We aimed to comprehensively investigate its biological characteristics and clinical value in glioma. We analyzed 699 glioma samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas as training cohort and 325 samples from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas as validation cohort. All the statistical analyses and figures were generated with R. ANXA2 was overexpressed significantly in high-grade glioma, isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type and mesenchymal-subtype glioma. ANXA2 was a special indicator of mesenchymal subtype. The survival analysis showed that highly-expressed ANXA2 was related to worse survival status as an independent factor of poor prognosis. Further gene ontology analysis showed that ANXA2 was mainly involved in immune response and inflammatory activities of glioma. Subsequent correlation analysis showed that ANXA2 was positively correlated with HCK, LCK, MHC II, STAT1 and interferon but negatively with IgG. Meanwhile, ANXA2 was positively related to the infiltration of tumor-related macrophages, regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Our study revealed that ANXA2 is a biomarker closely related to the malignant phenotype and poor prognosis of glioma, and plays an important role in immune response, inflammatory activity and immunosuppression.",
Proline metabolism supports metastasis formation and could be inhibited to selectively target metastasizing cancer cells,"Ilaria Elia, Dorien Broekaert, Stefan Christen, Ruben Boon, Enrico Radaelli, Martin F. Orth, Catherine Verfaillie, Thomas G. P. Grünewald, Sarah-Maria Fendt",2017-05-11,"Metastases are the leading cause of mortality in patients with cancer. Metastasis formation requires cancer cells to adapt their cellular phenotype. However, how metabolism supports this adaptation of cancer cells is poorly defined. We use 2D versus 3D cultivation to induce a shift in the cellular phenotype of breast cancer cells. We discover that proline catabolism via proline dehydrogenase (Prodh) supports growth of breast cancer cells in 3D culture. Subsequently, we link proline catabolism to in vivo metastasis formation. In particular, we find that PRODH expression and proline catabolism is increased in metastases compared to primary breast cancers of patients and mice. Moreover, inhibiting Prodh is sufficient to impair formation of lung metastases in the orthotopic 4T1 and EMT6.5 mouse models, without adverse effects on healthy tissue and organ function. In conclusion, we discover that Prodh is a potential drug target for inhibiting metastasis formation.",

Hentze, Andreas E. Kulozik",2024-04-01,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor with a strong tendency to metastasize, limiting the prognosis of affected patients. Genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses have demonstrated the exquisite molecular complexity of this tumor, but have not sufficiently defined the underlying mechanisms or identified promising therapeutic targets. To systematically explore RNA-protein interactions relevant to OS, we define the RNA interactomes together with the full proteome and the transcriptome of cells from five malignant bone tumors (four osteosarcomata and one malignant giant cell tumor of the bone) and from normal mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts. These analyses uncover both systematic changes of the RNA-binding activities of defined RNA-binding proteins common to all osteosarcomata and individual alterations that are observed in only a subset of tumors. Functional analyses reveal a particular vulnerability of these tumors to translation inhibition and a positive feedback loop involving the RBP IGF2BP3 and the transcription factor Myc which affects cellular translation and OS cell viability. Our results thus provide insight into potentially clinically relevant RNA-binding protein-dependent mechanisms of osteosarcoma.",
Current evidence on the relationships among five polymorphisms in the matrix metalloproteinases genes and prostate cancer risk,"Jiandong Gui, Hangsheng Zhou, Sixin Li, Anjie Chen, Qing Liu, Lijie Zhu, Yuanyuan Mi",2024-05-18,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) had a variety of subtypes, which may be related to tumor invasion and angiogenesis, and the polymorphisms from MMPs have been also associated with the susceptibility to a variety of tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa). However, previous studies have not systematically analyzed the association between MMP and prostate cancer, so we conducted systematic data collection and analyzed to evaluate the relationship among polymorphisms in MMPs and PCa susceptibility. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar for all papers published up to Apr 3rd, 2023, and systematically analyzed the relationship among MMP1-1607 2G/1G, MMP2-1306 T/C, MMP2-735 T/C, MMP7-181 G/A, MMP9-1562 T/C and PCa susceptibility using multiple comparative models and subgroup analyses. We found that MMP2-1306 T/C polymorphism showed associations with PCa susceptibility, with the Ethnicity subgroup (Asian) being more pronounced. Similarly, MMP9-1562 T/C has also had associations with PCa susceptibility. Our current study found that the polymorphisms of, MMP2-1306 T/C, and MMP9-1562 T/C had strong associations with PCa risk.","Prostate cancer, Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), Polymorphism, Tumor marker, Meta-analysis"
Iodine nanoparticle radiotherapy of human breast cancer growing in the brains of athymic mice,"James F. Hainfeld, Sharif M. Ridwan, F. Yaroslav Stanishevskiy, Henry M. Smilowitz",2020-09-24,"About 30% of breast cancers metastasize to the brain; those widely disseminated are fatal typically in 3–4 months, even with the best available treatments, including surgery, drugs, and radiotherapy. To address this dire situation, we have developed iodine nanoparticles (INPs) that target brain tumors after intravenous (IV) injection. The iodine then absorbs X-rays during radiotherapy (RT), creating free radicals and local tumor damage, effectively boosting the local RT dose at the tumor. Efficacy was tested using the very aggressive human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC, MDA-MB-231 cells) growing in the brains of athymic nude mice. With a well-tolerated non-toxic IV dose of the INPs (7 g iodine/kg body weight), tumors showed a heavily iodinated rim surrounding the tumor having an average uptake of 2.9% iodine by weight, with uptake peaks at 4.5%. This is calculated to provide a dose enhancement factor of approximately 5.5 (peaks at 8.0), the highest ever reported for any radiation-enhancing agents. With RT alone (15 Gy, single dose), all animals died by 72 days; INP pretreatment resulted in longer-term remissions with 40% of mice surviving 150 days and 30% surviving > 280 days.",
Enhancing DOX efficacy against NSCLC through UDCA-mediated modulation of the TGF-β/MAPK autophagy pathways,"Ying Li, Helian Zhao, Zhoumin Shen, Yao Zheng, Yuanyuan Jiang, Ying Song, Yimin Cai",2024-11-08,"Lung carcinoma, predominantly manifested as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), significantly contributes to oncological mortality, underscoring an imperative for novel therapeutic paradigms. Amidst this context, the present investigation delineates the synergistic potentiation of doxorubicin (DOX)—a canonical chemotherapeutic—by Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a compound with a historical pedigree in hepatobiliary medicine, now repositioned within oncological pharmacotherapy due to its dichotomous cellular modulation—affording cytoprotection to non-malignant epithelia whilst eliciting apoptotic cascades in neoplastic counterparts. This study, through a rigorous methodological framework, elucidates UDCA’s capacity to inhibit NSCLC cellular proliferation and induce apoptosis, thereby significantly amplifying DOX’s chemotherapeutic efficacy. Notably, the co-administration of UDCA and DOX was observed to attenuate DOX-induced autophagy via the modulation of the TGF-β/MAPK signaling axis, a pathway pivotal in mediating cellular survival and autophagic mechanisms. Such findings not only underscore the therapeutic potential of UDCA as a chemosensitizer but also illuminate the molecular underpinnings of its modulatory effects, thereby contributing to the corpus of knowledge necessary to surmount chemoresistance in NSCLC. The implications of this research are twofold: firstly, it offers a compelling evidence base for the clinical reevaluation of UDCA in combinatory chemotherapeutic regimens; secondly, it posits a novel mechanistic insight into the modulation of chemotherapeutic efficacy and resistance. Collectively, these insights advocate for the expedited clinical translation of UDCA-DOX synergy, potentially heralding a paradigm shift in the management of NSCLC, thereby addressing a critical lacuna in contemporary oncological therapy.","Autophagy, Chemotherapy, Non-small cell lung cancer, Ursodeoxycholic acid, Doxorubicin, TGF-β/MAPK pathway"
Prediction of viral oncoproteins through the combination of generative adversarial networks and machine learning techniques,"Jorge F. Beltrán, Lisandra Herrera-Belén, Alejandro J. Yáñez, Luis Jimenez",2024-11-07,"Viral oncoproteins play crucial roles in transforming normal cells into cancer cells, representing a significant factor in the etiology of various cancers. Traditionally, identifying these oncoproteins is both time-consuming and costly. With advancements in computational biology, bioinformatics tools based on machine learning have emerged as effective methods for predicting biological activities. Here, for the first time, we propose an innovative approach that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with supervised learning methods to enhance the accuracy and generalizability of viral oncoprotein prediction. Our methodology evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine. In ten-fold cross-validation on our training dataset, the GAN-enhanced Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance metrics: 0.976 accuracy, 0.976 F1 score, 0.977 precision, 0.976 sensitivity, and 1.0 AUC. During independent testing, this model achieved 0.982 accuracy, 0.982 F1 score, 0.982 precision, 0.982 sensitivity, and 1.0 AUC. These results establish our new tool, VirOncoTarget, accessible via a web application. We anticipate that VirOncoTarget will be a valuable resource for researchers, enabling rapid and reliable viral oncoprotein prediction and advancing our understanding of their role in cancer biology.","Virus, Oncoprotein, Machine learning, Deep learning, Random forest, Multilayer perceptron"
Volumetric body composition analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas reveals novel body composition traits and molecular markers Associated with Renal Carcinoma outcomes,"Olesya Mironchuk, Andrew L.

Ippolito",2024-11-06,"Clinically, the body mass index remains the most frequently used metric of overall obesity, although it is flawed by its inability to account for different adipose (i.e., visceral, subcutaneous, and inter/intramuscular) compartments, as well as muscle mass. Numerous prior studies have demonstrated linkages between specific adipose or muscle compartments to outcomes of multiple diseases. Although there are no universally accepted standards for body composition measurement, many studies use a single slice at the L3 vertebral level. In this study, we use computed tomography (CT) studies from patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to compare current L3-based techniques with volumetric techniques, demonstrating potential limitations with level-based approaches for assessing outcomes. In addition, we identify gene expression signatures in normal kidney that correlate with fat and muscle body composition traits that can be used to predict sex-specific outcomes in renal cell carcinoma.",
Transcriptomic analysis of melanoma cells reveals an association of α-synuclein with regulation of the inflammatory response,"Santhanasabapathy Rajasekaran, Siyuan Cheng, Nithya Gajendran, Sahar Shekoohi, Liudmila Chesnokova, Xiuping Yu, Stephan N. Witt",2024-11-07,"The Parkinson’s disease protein, alpha-synuclein (α-syn/SNCA), is highly expressed in neurons and melanomas. The goal of this study was to reveal the mechanism(s) of α-syn’s involvement in melanoma pathogenesis. To decipher the genes and pathways affected by α-syn, we conducted an RNA sequencing analysis of human SK-MEL-28 cells and several SK-MEL-28 SNCA-KO clones. We identified 1098 significantly up-regulated genes and 660 significantly down-regulated genes. Several of the upregulated genes are related to the immune system, i.e., the inflammatory response and the matrisome. We validated five upregulated genes (IL-1β, SAA1, IGFBP5, CXCL8, and CXCL10) by RT-qPCR and detected IGFBP5 and IL-1β in spent media of control and SNCA-KO cells. The levels of each of these secreted proteins were significantly higher in the spent media of the SNCA-KO clones than control cells. These secreted proteins quite likely activate the immune response against SNCA-KO cells. We suggest that, conversely, high levels of α-syn expression in melanoma cells helps the cells evade the immune system by inhibiting the secretion of these immune activating factors.","α-synuclein, Chemokine, Cytokine, IGFBP5, IL-1β, Matrisome"
LNMAT1 promotes lymphatic metastasis of bladder cancer via CCL2 dependent macrophage recruitment,"Changhao Chen, Wang He, Jian Huang, Bo Wang, Hui Li, Qingqing Cai, Feng Su, Junming Bi, Hongwei Liu, Bin Zhang, Ning Jiang, Guangzheng Zhong, Yue Zhao, Wen Dong, Tianxin Lin",2018-09-20,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are the most abundant inflammatory infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment and contribute to lymph node (LN) metastasis. However, the precise mechanisms of TAMs-induced LN metastasis remain largely unknown. Herein, we identify a long noncoding RNA, termed Lymph Node Metastasis Associated Transcript 1 (LNMAT1), which is upregulated in LN-positive bladder cancer and associated with LN metastasis and prognosis. Through gain and loss of function approaches, we find that LNMAT1 promotes bladder cancer-associated lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis. Mechanistically, LNMAT1 epigenetically activates CCL2 expression by recruiting hnRNPL to CCL2 promoter, which leads to increased H3K4 tri-methylation that ensures hnRNPL binding and enhances transcription. Furthermore, LNMAT1-induced upregulation of CCL2 recruits macrophages into the tumor, which promotes lymphatic metastasis via VEGF-C excretion. These findings provide a plausible mechanism for LNMAT1-modulated tumor microenvironment in lymphatic metastasis and suggest that LNMAT1 may represent a potential therapeutic target for clinical intervention in LN-metastatic bladder cancer.",
A novel approach to engineering three-dimensional bladder tumor models for drug testing,"C. U. Monjaras-Avila, A. C. Luque-Badillo, J. V. M. Bacon, A. W. Wyatt, A. So, C. Chavez-Munoz",2024-11-06,"Bladder cancer (BCa) poses a significant health challenge, particularly affecting men with higher incidence and mortality rates. Addressing the need for improved predictive models in BCa treatment, this study introduces an innovative 3D in vitro patient-derived bladder cancer tumor model, utilizing decellularized pig bladders as scaffolds. Traditional 2D cell cultures, insufficient in replicating tumor microenvironments, have driven the development of sophisticated 3D models. The study successfully achieved pig bladder decellularization through multiple cycles of immersion in salt solutions, resulting in notable macroscopic and histological changes. This process confirmed the removal of cellular components while preserving the native extracellular matrix (ECM). Quantitative analysis demonstrated the efficacy of decellularization, with a remarkable reduction in DNA concentration, signifying the removal of over 95% of cellular material. In the development of the in vitro bladder cancer model, muscle invasive bladder cancer patients’ cells were cultured within decellularized pig bladders, yielding a three-dimensional cancer model. Optimal results were attained using an air–liquid interface technique, with cells injected directly into the scaffold at three distinct time points. Histological evaluations showcased characteristics resembling in vivo tumors derived from bladder cancer patients’ cells. To demonstrate the 3D cancer model’s effectiveness as a drug screening platform, the study treated it with Cisplatin (Cis), Gemcitabine (Gem), and a combination of both drugs. Comprehensive cell viability assays and histological analyses illustrated changes in cell survival and proliferation. The model exhibited promising correlations with clinical outcomes, boasting an 83.3% reliability rate in predicting treatment responses. Comparison with traditional 2D cultures and spheroids underscored the 3D model’s superiority in reliability, with an 83.3% predictive capacity compared to 50% for spheroids and 33.3% for 2D culture. Acknowledging limitations, such as the absence of immune and stromal components, the study suggests avenues for future improvements. In conclusion, this innovative 3D bladder cancer model, combining decellularization and patient-derived cells, marks a significant advancement in preclinical drug testing. Its potential for predicting treatment outcomes and capturing patient-specific responses opens new avenues for personalized medicine in bladder cancer therapeutics. Future refinements and validations with larger patient cohorts hold promise for revolutionizing BCa research and treatment strategies.","Bladder cancer, Cancer model, Decellularization, Recellularization, Tissue engineering"
Integrating histopathology and transcriptomics for spatial tumor microenvironment profiling in a melanoma case study,"Óscar Lapuente-Santana, Joan Kant, Federica Eduati",2024-11-07,"Local structures formed by cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play an important role in tumor development and treatment response. This study introduces SPoTLIghT, a computational framework providing a quantitative description of the tumor architecture from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. We trained a weakly supervised machine learning model on melanoma patients linking tile-level imaging features extracted from H&E slides to sample-level cell type quantifications derived from RNA-sequencing data. Using this model, SPoTLIghT provides spatial cellular maps for any H&E image, and converts them in graphs to derive 96 interpretable features capturing TME cellular organization. We show how SPoTLIghT’s spatial features can distinguish microenvironment subtypes and reveal nuanced immune infiltration structures not apparent in molecular data alone. Finally, we use SPoTLIghT to effectively predict patients’ prognosis in an independent melanoma cohort. SPoTLIghT enhances computational histopathology providing a quantitative and interpretable characterization of the spatial contexture of tumors.",

Here, we use phylogenetic techniques on data generated using whole-exome sequencing and copy number profiling of primary and multiple-matched metastatic tumours from ten autopsied patients to infer the evolutionary history of breast cancer progression. We observed two modes of disease progression. In some patients, all distant metastases cluster on a branch separate from their primary lesion. Clonal frequency analyses of somatic mutations show that the metastases have a monoclonal origin and descend from a common ‘metastatic precursor’. Alternatively, multiple metastatic lesions are seeded from different clones present within the primary tumour. We further show that a metastasis can be horizontally cross-seeded. These findings provide insights into breast cancer dissemination.",

A higher proportion of early-differentiated Memory Stem (TSCM) and Central Memory BM-T cells express multiple IR in relapsing patients than in CR patients. Exhausted BM-T cells at relapse display a restricted TCR repertoire, impaired effector functions and leukemia-reactive specificities. In 57 patients, early detection of severely exhausted (PD-1+Eomes+T-bet−) BM-TSCM predicts relapse. Accordingly, leukemia-specific T cells in patients prone to relapse display exhaustion markers, absent in patients maintaining long-term CR. These results highlight a wide, though reversible, immunological dysfunction in the BM of AML patients relapsing after HSCT and suggest new therapeutic opportunities for the disease.",
Stem cells derived exosomes as biological nano carriers for VCR sulfate for treating breast cancer stem cells,"Ahmed H. Farouk, Ahmed Aref, Belal A. Fathy, Ahmed N. Abdallah",2024-05-14,"Due to vincristine sulfate’s (VCR sulfate) toxicity and non-specific targeting, which might adversely damage healthy cells, its clinical application is restricted. In this study, we loaded VCR sulfate on exosomes generated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to enhance its targeted distribution. Exosomes are able to deliver molecules to specific cells and tissues and have therapeutic potential. In this study, we isolated exosomes from MSCs, and using probe-sonication approach loaded them with VCR sulfate. Using SRB assay, the cytotoxicity of VCR sulfate-Exo was assessed in T47D breast cancer cells, and the results were contrasted with those of free VCR sulfate. Then We labeled markers (CD44+/CD24−) in the cell line to assess the targeting effectiveness of VCR sulfate-Exo using flow cytometry. Our results showed that the cytotoxicity of VCR sulfate-Exo was nearly the same as that of VCR sulfate. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that VRC sulfate-Exo was more effectively targeted to MSCs than free VCR sulfate. Our study shows that loading VCR sulfate to MSCs-derived exosomes can improve their targeted delivery and lessen their side effects. Additional research is required to determine VCR sulfate-Exo’s in vivo effectiveness and safety and improve the loading and delivery strategies.",

We investigated the usefulness of systemic immunity markers associated with lymphocytes as predictive markers for PB therapy in patients with HER2-negative ABC. We retrospectively reviewed data from 114 patients with HER2-negative ABC who underwent PB therapy from November 2011 to December 2019. We calculated the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) as representative systemic immunity markers. The time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS) of the patients with high ALC, low NLR, and high LMR were significantly longer compared with those of the patients with low ALC, high NLR, and low LMR. A multivariable analysis revealed that high ALC, low NLR, and low PLR were independent predictors for TTF and high ALC, low NLR, and high LMR were independent predictors for OS. Systemic immunity markers were significantly associated with longer TTF and OS in patients who underwent PB therapy and may represent predictive markers for PB therapy in patients with HER2-negative ABC.",

Batchelor",2018-04-16,"Inhibitors of the mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) entered recently in clinical trials for glioma treatment. Mutant IDH1 produces high levels of 2-hydroxyglurate (2HG), thought to initiate oncogenesis through epigenetic modifications of gene expression. In this study, we show the initial evidence of the pharmacodynamics of a new mutant IDH1 inhibitor in glioma patients, using non-invasive 3D MR spectroscopic imaging of 2HG. Our results from a Phase 1 clinical trial indicate a rapid decrease of 2HG levels by 70% (CI 13%, P = 0.019) after 1 week of treatment. Importantly, inhibition of mutant IDH1 may lead to the reprogramming of tumor metabolism, suggested by simultaneous changes in glutathione, glutamine, glutamate, and lactate. An inverse correlation between metabolic changes and diffusion MRI indicates an effect on the tumor-cell density. We demonstrate a feasible radiopharmacodynamics approach to support the rapid clinical translation of rationally designed drugs targeting IDH1/2 mutations for personalized and precision medicine of glioma patients.",

Plasma was separated within six hours using differential centrifugation and aliquots stored at – 20/– 80 °C until further processing. Three methods for isolation of ccfDNA, and two combinations of kits for isolation of exosomes and exosomal RNA were tested. The quality and quantity of ccfDNA isolates were evaluated. Exosomes were characterised by determining size, concentration, and total and specific protein content. Expression of chosen microRNAs, miR-19a-3p and miR-92-3p, which have been implicated in CRC progression, were determined. The vacuum-column-based kit showed the highest quantities of isolated ccfDNA (P-value < 0.001). Kits for exosome isolation significantly differed in size (P-value = 0.016), concentration (P-value = 0.016) and protein content (P-value = 0.016). There was no significant difference in expressions of miR-19a-3p (P-value = 0.219) and miR-92a-3p (P-value = 0.094) between the two isolation kits. The new, adapted protocol described, enables simultaneous analysis of multiple elements when investigating potential biomarkers of CRC.","Circulating tumour DNA, Colorectal cancer, Exosomes, Liquid biopsy, Methodology challenges, microRNA"
Myc targeted CDK18 promotes ATR and homologous recombination to mediate PARP inhibitor resistance in glioblastoma,"Jian-Fang Ning, Monica Stanciu, Melissa R. Humphrey, Joshua Gorham, Hiroko Wakimoto, Reiko Nishihara, Jacqueline Lees, Lee Zou, Robert L. Martuza, Hiroaki Wakimoto, Samuel D. Rabkin",2019-07-02,"PARP inhibitors (PARPis) have clinical efficacy in BRCA-deficient cancers, but not BRCA-intact tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). We show that MYC or MYCN amplification in patient-derived glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) generates sensitivity to PARPi via Myc-mediated transcriptional repression of CDK18, while most tumors without amplification are not sensitive. In response to PARPi, CDK18 facilitates ATR activation by interacting with ATR and regulating ATR-Rad9/ATR-ETAA1 interactions; thereby promoting homologous recombination (HR) and PARPi resistance. CDK18 knockdown or ATR inhibition in GSCs suppressed HR and conferred PARPi sensitivity, with ATR inhibitors synergizing with PARPis or sensitizing GSCs. ATR inhibitor VE822 combined with PARPi extended survival of mice bearing GSC-derived orthotopic tumors, irrespective of PARPi-sensitivity. These studies identify a role of CDK18 in ATR-regulated HR. We propose that combined blockade of ATR and PARP is an effective strategy for GBM, even for low-Myc GSCs that do not respond to PARPi alone, and potentially other PARPi-refractory tumors.",
Automatic delineation of cervical cancer target volumes in small samples based on multi-decoder and semi-supervised learning and clinical application,"Haibo Peng, Tao Liu, Pengcheng Li, Fang Yang, Xing Luo, Xiaoqing Sun, Dong Gao, Fengyu Lin, Lecheng Jia, Ningyue Xu, Huigang Tan, Xi Wang, Tao Ren",2024-11-06,"Radiotherapy has been demonstrated to be one of the most significant treatments for cervical cancer, during which accurate and efficient delineation of target volumes is critical. To alleviate the data demand of deep learning and promote the establishment and promotion of auto-segmentation models in small and medium-sized oncology departments and single centres, we proposed an auto-segmentation algorithm to determine the cervical cancer target volume in small samples based on multi-decoder and semi-supervised learning (MDSSL), and we evaluated the accuracy via an independent test cohort.

The clinical target volumes (CTVs) of the primary tumour area (CTV1) and pelvic lymph drainage area (CTV2) were delineated. For definitive radiotherapy (dRT), the primary gross target volume (GTVp) was simultaneously delineated. According to the data characteristics for small samples, the MDSSL network structure based on 3D U-Net was established to train the model by combining clinical anatomical information, which was compared with other segmentation methods, including supervised learning (SL) and transfer learning (TL). The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95) and average surface distance (ASD) were used to evaluate the segmentation performance. The ability of the segmentation algorithm to improve the efficiency of online adaptive radiation therapy (ART) was assessed via geometric indicators and a subjective evaluation of radiation oncologists (ROs) in prospective clinical applications. Compared with the SL model and TL model, the proposed MDSSL model displayed the best DSC, HD95 and ASD overall, especially for the GTVp of dRT. We calculated the above geometric indicators in the range of the ground truth (head-foot direction). In the test set, the DSC, HD95 and ASD of the MDSSL model were 0.80/5.85 mm/0.95 mm for CTV1 of post-operative radiotherapy (pRT), 0.84/ 4.88 mm/0.73 mm for CTV2 of pRT, 0.84/6.58 mm/0.89 mm for GTVp of dRT, 0.85/5.36 mm/1.35 mm for CTV1 of dRT, and 0.84/4.09 mm/0.73 mm for CTV2 of dRT, respectively. In a prospective clinical study of online ART, the target volume modification time (MTime) was 3–5 min for dRT and 2–4 min for pRT, and the main duration of CTV1 modification was approximately 2 min. The introduction of the MDSSL method successfully improved the accuracy of auto-segmentation for the cervical cancer target volume in small samples, showed good consistency with RO delineation and satisfied clinical requirements. In this prospective online ART study, the application of the segmentation model was demonstrated to be useful for reducing the target volume delineation time and improving the efficiency of the online ART workflow, which can contribute to the development and promotion of cervical cancer online ART.","Multi-decoder semi-supervised learning, Small samples, Auto-segmentation, Cervical cancer, Online adaptive radiation therapy"
Inhibiting the system xC−/glutathione axis selectively targets cancers with mutant-p53 accumulation,"David S. Liu, Cuong P. Duong, Sue Haupt, Karen G. Montgomery, Colin M. House, Walid J. Azar, Helen B. Pearson, Oliver M. Fisher, Matthew Read, Glen R. Guerra, Ygal Haupt, Carleen Cullinane, Klas G. Wiman, Lars Abrahmsen, Wayne A. Phillips, Nicholas J. Clemons",2017-03-28,"TP53, a critical tumour suppressor gene, is mutated in over half of all cancers resulting in mutant-p53 protein accumulation and poor patient survival. Therapeutic strategies to target mutant-p53 cancers are urgently needed. We show that accumulated mutant-p53 protein suppresses the expression of SLC7A11, a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xC−, through binding to the master antioxidant transcription factor NRF2. This diminishes glutathione synthesis, rendering mutant-p53 tumours susceptible to oxidative damage. System xC− inhibitors specifically exploit this vulnerability to preferentially kill cancer cells with stabilized mutant-p53 protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLC7A11 expression is a novel and robust predictive biomarker for APR-246, a first-in-class mutant-p53 reactivator that also binds and depletes glutathione in tumours, triggering lipid peroxidative cell death. Importantly, system xC− antagonism strongly synergizes with APR-246 to induce apoptosis in mutant-p53 tumours. We propose a new paradigm for targeting cancers that accumulate mutant-p53 protein by inhibiting the SLC7A11–glutathione axis.",
First-line benmelstobart plus anlotinib and chemotherapy in advanced or metastatic/recurrent esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a multi-center phase 2 study,"Ning Li, Jin Xia, Xiaohui Gao, Jianwei Zhou, Yonggui Hong, Donghai Cui, Xuesong Zhao, Tao Wu, Yanzhen Guo, Junsheng Wang, Suxia Luo",2024-11-08,"Although first-line immunochemotherapy has improved prognosis for patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), more effective strategies still require further investigation. This multi-center, phase II study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05013697) assessed the feasibility of benmelstobart (a novel PD-L1 inhibitor) plus anlotinib (multitargeted TKI) and chemotherapy in advanced or metastatic/recurrent ESCC. Eligible patients received 4–6 cycles (21-day) of benmelstobart (1200 mg), anlotinib (10 mg) plus paclitaxel (135 mg/m2)/cisplatin (60–75 mg/m2), then maintained with benmelstobart and anlotinib. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed according to RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints were tumor response, overall survival (OS), and safety assessed by adverse events (AEs). From September 2021 to November 2023, 50 patients were enrolled and received study treatment. With median follow-up of 23.7 months as of April 1, 2024, median PFS was 14.9 months (95% CI, 11.4-not estimable [NE]) and the 1-year PFS was 58.5% (95% CI, 41.9%–71.9%). Among 50 patients, confirmed objective response rate was 72.0% and disease control rate was 84.0%. Median duration of response of 36 responders was 16.2 months (95% CI, 10.2-NE). At the cutoff date, 31 patients remained alive; median OS was not reached (95% CI, 13.2 months-NE) with 1-year OS of 74.8% (95% CI, 59.8%–84.8%). Forty-six (92.0%) patients reported treatment-related AEs, with 37 (74.0%) were grade ≥3. Overall, benmelstobart plus anlotinib and chemotherapy showed promising efficacy and acceptable toxicity in advanced or metastatic/recurrent ESCC.",
Stat3 regulates centrosome clustering in cancer cells via Stathmin/PLK1,"Edward J. Morris, Eiko Kawamura, Jordan A. Gillespie, Aruna Balgi, Nagarajan Kannan, William J. Muller, Michel Roberge, Shoukat Dedhar",2017-05-05,"Cancer cells frequently have amplified centrosomes that must be clustered together to form a bipolar mitotic spindle, and targeting centrosome clustering is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. A high-content chemical screen for inhibitors of centrosome clustering identified Stattic, a Stat3 inhibitor. Stat3 depletion and inhibition in cancer cell lines and in tumours in vivo caused significant inhibition of centrosome clustering and viability. Here we describe a transcription-independent mechanism for Stat3-mediated centrosome clustering that involves Stathmin, a Stat3 interactor involved in microtubule depolymerization, and the mitotic kinase PLK1. Furthermore, PLK4-driven centrosome amplified breast tumour cells are highly sensitive to Stat3 inhibitors. We have identified an unexpected role of Stat3 in the regulation of centrosome clustering, and this role of Stat3 may be critical in identifying tumours that are sensitive to Stat3 inhibitors.",
Integrated proteogenomic and metabolomic characterization of papillary thyroid cancer with different recurrence risks,"Ning Qu, Di Chen, Ben Ma, Lijun Zhang, Qiuping Wang, Yuting Wang, Hongping Wang, Zhaoxian Ni, Wen Wang, Tian Liao, Jun Xiang, Yulong Wang, Shi Jin, Dixin Xue, Weili Wu, Yu Wang, Qinghai Ji, Hui He, Hai-long Piao, Rongliang Shi",2024-04-12,"Although papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has a good prognosis, its recurrence rate is high and remains a core concern in the clinic. Molecular factors contributing to different recurrence risks (RRs) remain poorly defined. Here, we perform an integrative proteogenomic and metabolomic characterization of 102 Chinese PTC patients with different RRs. Genomic profiling reveals that mutations in MUC16 and TERT promoter as well as multiple gene fusions like NCOA4-RET are enriched by the high RR. Integrative multi-omics analyses further describe the multi-dimensional characteristics of PTC, especially in metabolism pathways, and delineate dominated molecular patterns of different RRs. Moreover, the PTC patients are clustered into four subtypes (CS1: low RR and BRAF-like; CS2: high RR and metabolism type, worst prognosis; CS3: high RR and immune type, better prognosis; CS4: high RR and BRAF-like) based on the omics data. Notably, the subtypes display significant differences considering BRAF and TERT promoter mutations, metabolism and immune pathway profiles, epithelial cell compositions, and various clinical factors (especially RRs and prognosis) as well as druggable targets. This study can provide insights into the complex molecular characteristics of PTC recurrences and help promote early diagnosis and precision treatment of recurrent PTC.",

However, its effective targeting has been impeded by issues such as rapid clearance and cytokine release syndrome observed with previous VISTA antibodies. Here we demonstrate that SNS-101, a newly developed pH-selective VISTA antibody, addresses these challenges. Structural and biochemical analyses confirmed the pH-selectivity and unique epitope targeted by SNS-101. These properties confer favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles on SNS-101. In syngeneic tumor models utilizing human VISTA knock-in mice, SNS-101 shows in vivo efficacy when combined with a PD-1 inhibitor, modulates cytokine and chemokine signaling, and alters the tumor microenvironment. In summary, SNS-101, currently in Phase I clinical trials, emerges as a promising therapeutic biologic for a wide range of patients whose cancer is refractory to current immunotherapy regimens.",
Multi-task Bayesian model combining FDG-PET/CT imaging and clinical data for interpretable high-grade prostate cancer prognosis,"Maxence Larose, Louis Archambault, Nawar Touma, Raphaël Brodeur, Félix Desroches, Nicolas Raymond, Daphnée Bédard-Tremblay, Danahé LeBlanc, Fatemeh Rasekh, Hélène Hovington, Bertrand Neveu, Martin Vallières, Frédéric Pouliot",2024-11-06,"We propose a fully automatic multi-task Bayesian model, named Bayesian Sequential Network (BSN), for predicting high-grade (Gleason \(\ge\) 8) prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis using pre-prostatectomy FDG-PET/CT images and clinical data. BSN performs one classification task and five survival tasks: predicting lymph node invasion (LNI), biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCR-FS), metastasis-free survival, definitive androgen deprivation therapy-free survival, castration-resistant PCa-free survival, and PCa-specific survival (PCSS). Experiments are conducted using a dataset of 295 patients. BSN outperforms widely used nomograms on all tasks except PCSS, leveraging multi-task learning and imaging data. BSN also provides automated prostate segmentation, uncertainty quantification, personalized feature-based explanations, and introduces dynamic predictions, a novel approach that relies on short-term outcomes to refine long-term prognosis. Overall, BSN shows great promise in its ability to exploit imaging and clinicopathological data to predict poor outcome patients that need treatment intensification with loco-regional or systemic adjuvant therapy for high-risk PCa.","Prostate cancer, Prognosis, Multi-task, Multi-modal, FDG-PET/CT, Segmentation, Bayesian"
Low pan-immune-inflammation-value predicts better chemotherapy response and survival in breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"Ahmet Bilgehan Şahin, Erdem Cubukcu, Birol Ocak, Adem Deligonul, Sibel Oyucu Orhan, Sahsine Tolunay, Mustafa Sehsuvar Gokgoz, Sibel Cetintas, Gorkem Yarbas, Kazım Senol, Mehmet Refik Goktug, Zeki Burak Yanasma, Ulviyya Hasanzade, Turkkan Evrensel",2021-07-19,"Blood-based biomarkers reflect systemic inflammation status and have prognostic and predictive value in solid malignancies. As a recently defined biomarker, Pan-Immune-Inflammation-Value (PIV) integrates different peripheral blood cell subpopulations. This retrospective study of collected data aimed to assess whether PIV may predict the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in Turkish women with breast cancer. The study consisted of 743 patients with breast cancer who were scheduled to undergo NAC before attempting cytoreductive surgery. A pre-treatment complete blood count was obtained in the two weeks preceding NAC, and blood-based biomarkers were calculated from absolute counts of relevant cell populations. The pCR was defined as the absence of tumor cells in both the mastectomy specimen and lymph nodes. Secondary outcome measures included disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). One hundred seven patients (14.4%) had pCR. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, optimal cut-off values for the neutrophile-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte (PLR), PIV, and Ki-67 index were determined as ≥ 2.34, ≥ 0.22, ≥ 131.8, ≥ 306.4, and  ≥ 27, respectively. The clinical tumor (T) stage, NLR, MLR, PLR, PIV, estrogen receptor (ER) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) status, and Ki-67 index were significantly associated with NAC response in univariate analyses. However, multivariate analysis revealed that the clinical T stage, PIV, ER status, HER-2 status, and Ki-67 index were independent predictors for pCR. Moreover, the low PIV group patients had significantly better DFS and OS than those in the high PIV group (p = 0.034, p = 0.028, respectively). Based on our results, pre-treatment PIV seems as a predictor for pCR and survival, outperforming NLR, MLR, PLR in predicting pCR in Turkish women with breast cancer who received NAC. However, further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",
Prognostic impact of circulating tumor DNA detection in portal and peripheral blood in resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients,"Charlotte Maulat, Cindy Canivet, Bastien Cabarrou, Anne Pradines, Janick Selves, Anne Casanova, Aurélia Doussine, Naïma Hanoun, Emmanuel Cuellar, Paul Boulard, Nicolas Carrère, Louis Buscail, Barbara Bournet, Fabrice Muscari, Pierre Cordelier",2024-11-08,"In PDAC patients, ctDNA detection’s prognostic significance needs validation especially in resected patients. This study investigated ctDNA kinetics in portal and peripheral blood before and after resection, and whether tissue mobilization during surgery influences ctDNA detection. In this single-center prospective cohort, portal and peripheral blood were drawn during pancreaticoduodenectomy before and after tissue mobilization, during 12 postoperative months and were associated with overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) and CA19-9 (secondary endpoints). Tumor mutations were identified using next-generation-sequencing and ctDNA detected by digital droplet PCR. From 2018 to 2022, 34 patients were included. The 2-year RFS and OS were 47.6%(95%CI[29.5; 63.6]) and 65.7%(95%CI[46.5; 79.4]) respectively. Intraoperatively, ctDNA detection in portal or peripheral blood was associated with worse RFS (HR[95%CI]3.26[1.26; 8.45],p = 0.010) and OS (HR[95%CI]5.46[1.65;18.01],p = 0.002). Portal vein sampling did not improve ctDNA detection. CtDNA levels were increased by 2.5-fold (p = 0.031) in peripheral blood after tissue mobilization but not significantly linked to RFS or OS. Detecting ctDNA intraoperatively was correlated with poorer RFS (HR [95% CI] 3.26 [1.26;8.45], p = 0.010) and 0S (HR [95% CI] 5.46 [1.65;18.01], p = 0.002). Portal vein sampling did not improve ctDNA detection. Tissue mobilization increases ctDNA levels.

Cis-perturbation of cancer drivers by the HTLV-1/BLV proviruses is an early determinant of leukemogenesis,"Nicolas Rosewick, Keith Durkin, Maria Artesi, Ambroise Marçais, Vincent Hahaut, Philip Griebel, Natasa Arsic, Véronique Avettand-Fenoel, Arsène Burny, Carole Charlier, Olivier Hermine, Michel Georges, Anne Van den Broeke",2017-05-23,"Human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) and bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infect T- and B-lymphocytes, respectively, provoking a polyclonal expansion that will evolve into an aggressive monoclonal leukaemia in ∼5% of individuals following a protracted latency period. It is generally assumed that early oncogenic changes are largely dependent on virus-encoded products, especially TAX and HBZ, while progression to acute leukaemia/lymphoma involves somatic mutations, yet that both are independent of proviral integration site that has been found to be very variable between tumours. Here, we show that HTLV-1/BLV proviruses are integrated near cancer drivers which they affect either by provirus-dependent transcription termination or as a result of viral antisense RNA-dependent cis-perturbation. The same pattern is observed at polyclonal non-malignant stages, indicating that provirus-dependent host gene perturbation contributes to the initial selection of the multiple clones characterizing the asymptomatic stage, requiring additional alterations in the clone that will evolve into full-blown leukaemia/lymphoma.",

Detection of monoclonal PCs is mandatory for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome; however, the usefulness of EuroFlow-based next-generation flow cytometry (EuroFlow-NGF) in POEMS syndrome for detecting monoclonal PCs in bone marrow (BM) and the gating strategy suitable for flow cytometry study of POEMS syndrome remain unknown. We employed EuroFlow-NGF-based single-tube eight-color multiparameter flow cytometry (MM-flow) and established a new gating strategy (POEMS-flow) to detect the monoclonal PCs in POEMS syndrome, gating CD38 broadly from dim to bright and CD45 narrowly from negative to dim compared to MM-flow. MM-flow detected monoclonal PCs in 9/25 (36.0%) cases, including 2/2 immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)-negative cases (100%). However, POEMS-flow detected monoclonal PCs in 18/25 cases (72.0%), including 2/2 IFE-negative cases (100%). POEMS-flow detected monoclonal PCs with immunophenotypes of CD19− in 17/18 (94.4%). In six cases where post-treatment samples were available, the size of the clones was significantly reduced after the treatment (P = 0.031). POEMS-flow can enhance the identification rate of monoclonal PCs in POEMS syndrome and become a valuable tool for the diagnosis of POEMS syndrome.","POEMS syndrome, Multiparameter flow cytometry, EuroFlow, Immunophenotype"
Effects of antipsychotic drugs during radiotherapy in breast cancer in South Korea: a retrospective cohort study,"In Gyu Hwang, Sun Mi Kim, Dae Ryong Kang, Tae-Hwa Go, Se Hwa Hong, Shin Young Park, Hyunho Lee, Jin Hwa Choi",2024-11-07,"In this study, we aimed to investigate the nationwide utilization of antipsychotic drugs (APDs) during radiotherapy and evaluate their association with survival in patients with breast cancer. This retrospective cohort study used the National Health Insurance Service database in Korea and included patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 2010 to 2020 who received radiotherapy. The APDs included in the analysis were aripiprazole, quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine, and the APD prescription details included prescription time, dosage, and duration. Among 170,226 patients with breast cancer treated with radiotherapy, 3361 (1.97%) received APD during radiotherapy. Use of APDs was significantly associated with higher mortality in all patients and in a subgroup of patients excluding those with metastasis or other cancers. Among patients taking APD during radiotherapy, those with accompanied psychiatric history and long-term APD use for ≥ 3 months were associated with lower mortality, whereas patients who started APD during radiotherapy had higher mortality than those who started APD before radiotherapy. The high mortality observed in breast cancer patients using APDs during radiotherapy could be influenced by the underlying conditions that necessitated APD use. Further studies are needed to determine the effects of APDs during radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer.","Antipsychotic drug, Breast cancer, Radiotherapy, Survival"
Combined activation of MAP kinase pathway and β-catenin signaling cause deep penetrating nevi,"Iwei Yeh, Ursula E. Lang, Emeline Durieux, Meng Kian Tee, Aparna Jorapur, A.

Bastian, Arnaud de la Fouchardière",2017-09-21,"Deep penetrating nevus (DPN) is characterized by enlarged, pigmented melanocytes that extend through the dermis. DPN can be difficult to distinguish from melanoma but rarely displays aggressive biological behavior. Here, we identify a combination of mutations of the β-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as characteristic of DPN. Mutations of the β-catenin pathway change the phenotype of a common nevus with BRAF mutation into that of DPN, with increased pigmentation, cell volume and nuclear cyclin D1 levels. Our results suggest that constitutive β-catenin pathway activation promotes tumorigenesis by overriding dependencies on the microenvironment that constrain proliferation of common nevi. In melanoma that arose from DPN we find additional oncogenic alterations. We identify DPN as an intermediate stage in the step-wise progression from nevus to melanoma. In summary, we delineate specific genetic alterations and their sequential order, information that can assist in the diagnostic classification and grading of these distinctive neoplasms.",
A bicentric retrospective study of the correlation of EAU BCR risk groups with 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT detection in prostate cancer biochemical recurrence,"Nathan Poterszman, Charles Merlin, Charles Margail, Eric Ouvrard, Alessio Imperiale, François Somme",2024-05-13,"The European Association of Urology (EAU) has proposed a risk stratification for patients harboring biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy: ISUP < 4 and PSA doubling time (PSAdt) > 12 months for low risk, and ISUP ≥ 4 or PSAdt ≤ 12 months for high risk. This dual-center retrospective study aims to investigate the correlation between the EAU risk stratification for BCR following radical prostatectomy and the detection rate of lesions using 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT. Among the 71 included patients (58 high-risk, 13 low-risk), with a median PSA level of 1.43 ng/ml, PET/CT demonstrated a significantly higher positivity in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group (72.4% vs. 38.0%, p = 0.026). Analysis of recurrence sites revealed a similar proportion of pelvic-confined disease in both groups (24.1% vs. 23.1%, p = 0.935), but a significantly higher incidence of metastatic disease in the high-risk group (51.7% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.017), with detailed findings indicating an increased prevalence of bone metastases in the high-risk BCR group (37.8% vs. 7.7%, p = 0.048).

Identification of sentinel lymph node macrometastasis in breast cancer by deep learning based on clinicopathological characteristics,"Daqu Zhang, Miriam Svensson, Patrik Edén, Looket Dihge",2024-11-06,"The axillary lymph node status remains an important prognostic factor in breast cancer, and nodal staging using sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routine. Randomized clinical trials provide evidence supporting de-escalation of axillary surgery and omission of SLNB in patients at low risk. However, identifying sentinel lymph node macrometastases (macro-SLNMs) is crucial for planning treatment tailored to the individual patient. This study is the first to explore the capacity of deep learning (DL) models to identify macro-SLNMs based on preoperative clinicopathological characteristics. We trained and validated five multivariable models using a population-based cohort of 18,185 patients. DL models outperform logistic regression, with Transformer showing the strongest results, under the constraint that the sensitivity is no less than 90%, reflecting the sensitivity of SLNB. This highlights the feasibility of noninvasive macro-SLNM prediction using DL. Feature importance analysis revealed that patients with similar characteristics exhibited different nodal status predictions, indicating the need for additional predictors for further improvement.","Breast cancer, Lymphatic metastasis, Sentinel lymph node, Deep learning, Clinical decision support"
Fluorescence-guided tumor visualization of colorectal cancer using tumor-initiating probe yellow in preclinical models,"Sun Young Kim, Jinhyeon Kim, Hajung Kim, Young-Tae Chang, Hwa-Young Kwon, Jong Lyul Lee, Yong Sik Yoon, Chan Wook Kim, Seung-Mo Hong, Jin-ho Shin, Seung Wook Hong, Sung Wook Hwang, Byong Duk Ye, Jeong-Sik Byeon, Suk-Kyun Yang, Byung Ho Son, Seung-Jae Myung",2024-11-06,"Fluorescence-guided surgery has emerged as an innovative technique with promising applications in the treatment of various tumors, including colon cancer. Tumor-initiating probe yellow (TiY) has been discovered for identifying tumorigenic cells by unbiased phenotypic screening with thousands of diversity-oriented fluorescence library (DOFL) compounds in a patient-derived lung cancer cell model. This study demonstrated the clinical feasibility of TiY for tumor-specific fluorescence imaging in the tissues of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). To evaluate the efficacy of TiY in tumor imaging, surgical specimens were obtained, consisting of 36 tissues from 18 patients with CRC, for ex vivo molecular fluorescence imaging, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Orthotopic and chemically induced CRC mice models were administered TiY topically, and distinct tumor lesions were observed in 10 min by real-time fluorescence colonoscopy and ex vivo imaging. In a hepatic metastasis mouse model using splenic injection, TiY accumulation was detected in metastatic liver lesions through fluorescence imaging. Correlation analysis between TiY intensity and protein expression, assessed via immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, revealed a positive correlation between TiY and vimentin and Zeb1, which are known as epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers of cancers. A comparative analysis of TiY with other FDA-approved fluorescence probes such as ICG revealed greater quantitative differences in TiY fluorescence intensity between tumor and normal tissues than those observed with ICG. Altogether, these results demonstrated that TiY has a strong potential for visualizing CRC by fluorescence imaging in various preclinical models, which can be further translated for clinical use such as fluorescence-guided surgery. Furthermore, our data indicate that TiY is preferentially uptaken by cells with EMT induction and progression, and overexpressing vimentin and Zeb1 in patients with CRC.","Fluorescence-guided tumor imaging, Colorectal cancer, Tumor-initiating probe yellow, Epithelial-mesenchymal transition"

The study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022309771). Risk of bias for RCTs was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias (RoB2), and quasi-experimental studies with the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. PA significantly improved self-esteem during and after cancer treatment (pooled SMD = 0.32, p < 0.01). Specifically, aerobic PA (pooled SMD = 0.33, p = 0.04) and mind-body exercise (pooled SMD = 0.70, p = 0.03) had positive effects on self-esteem. Overall, PA interventions improved self-esteem during cancer treatment (pooled SMD = 0.50, p = 0.01) and in PA interventions lasting more than 12 weeks (pooled SMD = 0.44, p = 0.02). In conclusion, PA (specifically, aerobic and mind-body exercises) may have a positive effect on self-esteem during and after cancer treatment, with cancer status and the duration of the intervention being key factors.","Exercise interventions, Mental health, Cancer, Children, Adolescents, Adults"

Here, we analyze trajectory inference, deconvolute spatial transcriptomics at single-cell level and perform functional assays to generate a high-resolution integrated map of breast cancer (BC), with a focus on inflammatory and myofibroblastic (iCAF/myCAF) FAP+ CAF clusters. We identify 10 spatially-organized FAP+ CAF-related cellular niches, called EcoCellTypes, which are differentially localized within tumors. Consistent with their spatial organization, cancer cells drive the transition of detoxification-associated iCAF (Detox-iCAF) towards immunosuppressive extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing myCAF (ECM-myCAF) via a DPP4- and YAP-dependent mechanism. In turn, ECM-myCAF polarize TREM2+ macrophages, regulatory NK and T cells to induce immunosuppressive EcoCellTypes, while Detox-iCAF are associated with FOLR2+ macrophages in an immuno-protective EcoCellType. FAP+ CAF subpopulations accumulate differently according to the invasive BC status and predict invasive recurrence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which could help in identifying low-risk DCIS patients eligible for therapeutic de-escalation.",

Impact of dietary zinc on stimulated zinc secretion MRI in the healthy and malignant mouse prostate,"Veronica Clavijo Jordan, André F. Martins, Erica Dao, Kalotina Geraki, Sara Chirayil, Xiaodong Wen, Pooyan Khalighinejad, Daniel Parrott, Xiaojing Wang, Patricia Gonzalez Pagan, Neil Rofsky, Michael Farquharson, A. Dean Sherry",2024-11-06,"Previous studies have shown that the zinc-responsive MRI probe, GdL1, can distinguish healthy versus malignant prostate tissues based upon differences in zinc content and secretion. In this study, mice were fed chow containing low, normal, or high zinc content for 3 weeks before imaging glucose stimulated zinc secretion (GSZS) by MRI. The distribution of zinc in prostate tissue in these three groups was imaged by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF). A zinc deficiency caused systemic and organ-level dysregulation, weight loss, and altered zinc bioavailability. Zinc efflux from the prostate increased in parallel to dietary zinc in healthy mice but not in TRAMP mice, consistent with a lowered capacity to store dietary zinc in malignant cells. This differential zinc efflux suggests that a dietary supplement of zinc prior to a GSZS study may enhance image contrast between healthy and malignant prostate tissue, thereby improving the accuracy of prostate cancer detection in man.",
Identifying colorectal cancer subtypes and establishing a prognostic model using metabolic plasticity and ferroptosis genes,"Jingwen Guan, Simin Min, Yan Xia, Zhiguo Guo, Xiaolan Zhou",2024-11-08,"Metabolic plasticity and ferroptosis are essential for colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. The effects and prognostic value of metabolic plasticity- and ferroptosis-related genes (MPFRGs) in CRC remain unclear. We established a prognostic model for CRC patients by identifying important genes in metabolic plasticity and ferroptosis. Data of CRC patients were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus; MPFRG data were obtained from GeneCards and FerrDb. We performed functional (to explore differences between the two metabolic subtypes) and single-sample gene set (to assess the immune environment) enrichment analyses. Immunophenotype, tumor immunological dysfunction, and exclusion scores were assessed to determine patient immune responses. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression model comprising 10 significant differentially expressed genes of metabolic plasticity and ferroptosis (MPFDEGs) was constructed using TCGA training cohort and validated using the GSE17536 and GSE39582 datasets. We established a nomogram comprising metabolic plasticity- and ferroptosis-based signatures, revealing the clinical application and potential molecular mechanisms underlying the role of MPFRGs in CRC. Our model (developed based on 10 MPFDEGs) is efficient for calculating the overall survival of CRC patients. Our findings provide new strategies for the clinical management and individualized treatment of these patients.","Bioinformatics, Colorectal cancer, Ferroptosis, Immune infiltration, Metabolic plasticity, Prognostic factor"
Peritumoral tissue (PTT): increasing need for naming convention,"Dzenis Koca, Behnoush Abedi-Ardekani, Joel LeMaoult, Laurent Guyon",2024-09-02,"Various terms are used to describe non-malignant tissue located in the proximity of a tumor, belonging to the organ from which the tumor originated. Traditionally, these tissues, sometimes called “normal adjacent tissue” have been used as controls in cancer studies, and were considered representative of morphologically healthy, non-cancerous tissue. However, with the advancement of OMIC technologies, such tissues are increasingly recognized to be distinct from both tumor and healthy tissues. Furthermore, properties, characteristics, and role of these tissues in cancer formation and progression is increasingly studied. In order to make future research in this area more harmonized and more accessible, as well as to counter the widespread perception of normalcy, we are advocating the need for standardized naming convention. For this purpose, we propose the use of neutral and comprehensive term “Peritumoral Tissue” along with the acronym “PTT”. While significant amount of data on these tissues are publicly available, reuse of such data remains limited due to a lack of information on sample collection procedures. In order to facilitate future reuse of the data, we suggest a list of features that should be documented during sample collection procedures. These recommendations can aid the definition of Standard Operating Procedures.",

This is a retrospective, multicenter study. A total of 142 patients were included in the study who are HER2-positive breast cancer, aged ≤ 65 years, with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%, received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent surgery at 10 different oncology centers in Türkiye between October 2016 and December 2022. The treatment arms were divided into 4–6 cycles of docetaxel/trastuzumab/pertuzumab for arm A, 4 cycles of adriamycin/cyclophosphamide followed by 4 cycles of taxane/TP for arm B. There were 50 patients (35.2%) in arm A and 92 patients (64.8%) in arm B. The median follow-up of all of the patients was 19.9 months (95% CI 17.5–22.3). The 3-year DFS rates for treatment arms A and B were 90.0% and 83.8%, respectively, and the survival outcomes between the groups were similar (p = 0.34). Furthermore, the pathologic complete response rates were similar in both treatment arms, at 50.0% and 51.1%, respectively (p = 0.90).

Surprisingly, while rapid genomic profiling is becoming ubiquitous, the development of biomarkers usually involves the application of bespoke techniques that cannot be directly applied to other datasets. There is an urgent need for a systematic methodology to create biologically-interpretable molecular models that robustly predict key phenotypes. Here we present SIMMS (Subnetwork Integration for Multi-Modal Signatures): an algorithm that fragments pathways into functional modules and uses these to predict phenotypes. We apply SIMMS to multiple data types across five diseases, and in each it reproducibly identifies known and novel subtypes, and makes superior predictions to the best bespoke approaches. To demonstrate its ability on a new dataset, we profile 33 genes/nodes of the PI3K pathway in 1734 FFPE breast tumors and create a four-subnetwork prediction model. This model out-performs a clinically-validated molecular test in an independent cohort of 1742 patients. SIMMS is generic and enables systematic data integration for robust biomarker discovery.",
Armadillo repeat containing 12 promotes neuroblastoma progression through interaction with retinoblastoma binding protein 4,"Dan Li, Huajie Song, Hong Mei, Erhu Fang, Xiaojing Wang, Feng Yang, Huanhuan Li, Yajun Chen, Kai Huang, Liduan Zheng, Qiangsong Tong",2018-07-19,"Recent studies suggest the emerging roles of armadillo (ARM) family proteins in tumor progression. However, the functions and underlying mechanisms of ARM members in tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of neuroblastoma (NB) remain to be determined. Herein, we identify armadillo repeat containing 12 (ARMC12) as an ARM member associated with NB progression. ARMC12 promotes the growth and aggressiveness of NB cell lines. Mechanistically, ARMC12 physically interacts with retinoblastoma binding protein 4 (RBBP4) to facilitate the formation and activity of polycomb repressive complex 2, resulting in transcriptional repression of tumor suppressive genes. Blocking the interaction between ARMC12 and RBBP4 by cell-penetrating inhibitory peptide activates the downstream gene expression and suppresses the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of NB cells. Both ARMC12 and RBBP4 are upregulated in NB tissues, and are associated with unfavorable outcome of patients. These findings suggest the crucial roles of ARMC12 in tumor progression and a potential therapeutic approach for NB.",
Lymphopenia associated with whole-brain radiotherapy and its effects on clinical outcomes of patients with brain metastases,"Yue Wang, Weiwei Zeng, Wenyue Xie, Wei Zhao, Yonghong Chen, Guiping Yang",2024-09-12,"There is increasing awareness of radiotherapy’s potential side effects, such as lymphopenia. Therefore, this study aimed to establish the association between WBRT and the development of lymphopenia in patients with brain metastases undergoing brain radiotherapy (RT), along with evaluating the corresponding clinical outcomes. Including 116 patients with brain metastases undergoing brain radiotherapy, the study collected the absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) within 2 weeks before brain radiotherapy (pre-radiotherapy, pre-RT), as well as ones at 1 and 2 months after completing RT (post-RT). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify associations between radiation modality and post-RT ALC. The relationships between post-RT ALC and overall survival were evaluated with Kaplan–Meier analysis and a multivariate Cox regression model. The median ALC definitely decreased at 1 month post-RT, but at 2 months post-RT, gradually rose but not to the pre-RT ALC. The multivariate analysis identified WBRT and lower pre-RT ALC as independent risk factors associated with the decrease in post-RT ALC at 1 month. It also revealed more than 4 brain metastases, G3-4 lymphopenia at 1 month and lower post-RT ALC at 2 months exhibited significantly worse prognosis regardless of the radiation modality. However, there was indeed an independent correlation between radiation modality and the outcome of intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). To approach the feasibility and reasonableness of treatment, clinicians should carefully consider various factors to achieve long-term survival of patients.","Radiation-induced lymphopenia, Whole-brain radiotherapy, Brain metastases, Risk factor, Prognosis"
Stability of immobilized L-arginine deiminase from Penicillium chrysogenum and evaluation of its anticancer activity,"Hamed M. El-Shora, Gharieb S. El-Sayyad, Nessma A. El-Zawawy, Mohamed A. Abd El-Rheem, Metwally A. Metwally, Sally A. Metwally",2024-11-08,"The aim of the present work was to immobilize L-arginine deiminase on suitable supports such as chitosan, alginate, and silica gel to study its stability. Additionally, the study aims to investigate the anticancer effects of the free purified enzyme on hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep-G2) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines. L-arginine deiminase (ADI: EC 3.5.3.6) was immobilized on chitosan, Ca-alginate, and silica gel, with immobilization efficiencies of 89.0%, 72.8%, and 66.5%, respectively. The optimal immobilization time for the highest efficiency was 4 h. Increasing the concentration of glutaraldehyde improved the immobilization efficiency of ADI on chitosan. The chitosan-immobilized ADI retained about 45% of its activity after 8 cycles. The optimal pH values were 6 for the free purified ADI and 7 for the chitosan-immobilized ADI. The optimal temperature increased from 40 °C for the free enzyme to 45 °C after immobilization. The activation energies for the free and chitosan-immobilized enzymes were 71.335 kJ/mol and 64.011 kJ/mol, respectively. The Km values for the free and chitosan-immobilized ADI were 0.76 mM and 0.77 mM, respectively, while the Vmax values were 80.0 U/mg protein for the free ADI and 71.4 U/mg protein for the chitosan-immobilized ADI. After 30 days of storage at 4 °C, the residual activities were 40% for the free purified ADI and 84% for the chitosan-immobilized ADI. At 25 °C, the residual activities were 10% for the free ADI and 75% for the chitosan-immobilized ADI. The chitosan-immobilized ADI exhibited significantly higher stability against proteases such as pepsin and trypsin compared to the free enzyme. The purified ADI also demonstrated enhanced potential anticancer effects and significant cytotoxicity against the Hep-G2 and MCF-7 tumor cell lines compared to doxorubicin. These findings suggest that purified ADI has potential as an anticancer agent, though further in-depth studies are required.","L-arginine deiminase, Immobilization, Chitosan, Stability, Pepsin, Anticancer activity"
DNA methyltransferase inhibition upregulates MHC-I to potentiate cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in breast cancer,"Na Luo, Mellissa J. Nixon, Paula I. Gonzalez-Ericsson, Violeta Sanchez, Susan R. Opalenik, Huili Li, Cynthia A. Zahnow, Michael L. Nickels, Fei Liu, Mohammed N. Tantawy, Melinda E. Sanders, H. Charles Manning, Justin M. Balko",2018-01-16,"Potentiating anti-tumor immunity by inducing tumor inflammation and T cell-mediated responses are a promising area of cancer therapy. Immunomodulatory agents that promote these effects function via a wide variety of mechanisms, including upregulation of antigen presentation pathways. Here, we show that major histocompatibility class-I (MHC-I) genes are methylated in human breast cancers, suppressing their expression. Treatment of breast cancer cell lines with a next-generation hypomethylating agent, guadecitabine, upregulates MHC-I expression in response to interferon-γ. In murine tumor models of breast cancer, guadecitabine upregulates MHC-I in tumor cells promoting recruitment of CD8+ T cells to the microenvironment. Finally, we show that MHC-I genes are upregulated in breast cancer patients treated with hypomethylating agents. Thus, the immunomodulatory effects of hypomethylating agents likely involve upregulation of class-I antigen presentation to potentiate CD8+ T cell responses. These strategies may be useful to potentiate anti-tumor immunity and responses to checkpoint inhibition in immune-refractory breast cancers.",
Protein-RNA interaction dynamics reveal key regulators of oncogenic KRAS-driven cancers,"Ka-Yun Ban, Yong-woo Na, Juhan Song, Jong-Seo Kim, Jimi Kim",2024-11-07,"KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes across various cancers. Oncogenic KRAS mutations rewire cellular signaling, leading to significant alterations in gene expression. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a pivotal role in gene expression regulation by post-transcriptionally controlling various aspects of RNA metabolism. It has become clear that interactions between RBPs and RNA are frequently dysregulated in numerous cancers. However, how oncogenic KRAS mutations reshape the post-transcriptional regulatory network mediated by RBPs remains poorly understood. In this study, we systematically dissected oncogenic KRAS-driven alterations of RNA-RBP networks. We identified 35 cancer-associated RBPs with either increased or decreased RNA binding upon oncogenic KRAS activation, including PDCD11, which is essential for the viability of KRAS mutant cancers, and ELAVL2, which regulates cell migration in KRAS mutant lung cancers. Our study serves as a crucial resource for elucidating RBP regulatory networks in KRAS mutant cancers and may provide new avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting KRAS mutant malignancies.",
Elucidating the role of CYFIP2 in conferring cisplatin resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,"Zhang Peipei, Zhang Weiguang, Hong Zhinuan, Jiang Junfei, Wu Ningzi, Lin Jihong, Kang Mingqiang",2024-11-07,"Cisplatin (CDDP) serves as a vital component in the chemotherapeutic approach to treat esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, prolonged CDDP application frequently culminates in resistance, compromising therapeutic outcomes. Through genome-wide CRISPR library screening, our study elucidates the mechanisms underlying this resistance, pinpointing CYFIP2 as a pivotal mediator. Notably, the involvement CYFIP2 is characterized by pronounced autophagic activity and the modulation of multiple cellular pathways. Empirical validation was achieved by treating ESCC cell lines with CDDP, which resulted in an upsurge of CYFIP2 expression. The functional impact of CYFIP2 was further delineated through knockdown experiments, where a marked suppression in cell proliferation was observed, alongside a discernible decline in reactive oxygen species levels. This was complemented by a suite of assays and microscopic techniques, including GFP-LC3, mRFP-GFP-LC3, electron microscopy and western blot, which collectively affirmed the inhibitory effect of CYFIP2 knockdown on autophagic processes, particularly impeding autophagosome formation and their subsequent fusion with lysosomes. In vivo studies have also confirmed that CYFIP2 knockdown limits tumor progression and increases CDDP efficacy. Conclusively, our findings introduce CYFIP2 as a novel contributor to CDDP resistance in ESCC, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. This revelation not only deepens our understanding of resistance mechanisms but also paves the way for novel oncotherapeutic strategies, promising enhanced treatment efficacy against ESCC.","Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), Cisplatin, CRISPR library, CYFIP2"
FGF6 inhibits oral squamous cell carcinoma progression by regulating PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways,"Xuan Zhang, Yingjiao Xu, Lijuan Shi, Xiao Chen, Miaoling Hu, Mengxue Zhang, Minhai Nie, Xuqian Liu",2024-11-06,"To explore diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in the progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and to reveal their regulatory mechanisms in key pathways. A RayBiotech protein chip was used to screen differentially expressed serum proteins in OSCC, oral leukoplakia (OLK), and healthy participants. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis were used to determine the pathways enriched by characteristic differential proteins. Immunohistochemical analysis and western blotting were used to verify the expression of characteristic differential proteins and key regulatory factors in human tissues and in a nude mouse model. Fibroblast growth factor 6 (FGF6) was identified as a key differential protein and was weakly expressed in OSCC tissues. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and PI3K-AKT pathways were identified as key signaling pathways. The results showed that pERK, Cyclin D1, pAKT, and BCL2 were highly expressed in OSCC, Caspase9 was lowly expressed in OSCC. With an increase in FGF6 expression in nude mice, the expression of FGFR4, pERK, Cyclin D1, pAKT, BCL2, GPX4, and ACSL4 increased, and the expression of Caspase9 decreased. FGF6 may change the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and proliferation factors by binding to FGFR4 in the PI3K-AKT/MAPK pathway and may inhibit the ferroptosis of OSCC, thereby possibly participating in the process of inhibiting OSCC.","FGF6, OSCC, PI3K-AKT, MAPK, Ferroptosis"
Overcoming therapeutic resistance in oncolytic herpes virotherapy by targeting IGF2BP3-induced NETosis in malignant glioma,"Weiwei Dai, Ruotong Tian, Liubing Yu, Shasha Bian, Yuling Chen, Bowen Yin, Yuxuan Luan, Siqi Chen, Zhuoyang Fan, Rucheng Yan, Xin Pan, Yingyong Hou, Rong Li, Juxiang Chen, Minfeng Shu",2024-01-02,"Oncolytic virotherapy holds promise for cancer treatment, but the factors determining its oncolytic activity remain unclear. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are associated with cancer progression, yet their formation mechanism and role in oncolytic virotherapy remain elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that, in glioma, upregulation of IGF2BP3 enhances the expression of E3 ubiquitin protein ligase MIB1, promoting FTO degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This results in increased m6A-mediated CSF3 release and NET formation. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) stimulates IGF2BP3-induced NET formation in malignant glioma. In glioma models in female mice, a BET inhibitor enhances the oncolytic activity of oHSV by impeding IGF2BP3-induced NETosis, reinforcing virus replication through BRD4 recruitment with the CDK9/RPB-1 complex to HSV gene promoters. Our findings unveil the regulation of m6A-mediated NET formation, highlight oncolytic virus-induced NETosis as a critical checkpoint hindering oncolytic potential, and propose targeting NETosis as a strategy to overcome resistance in oncolytic virotherapy.",
Cyclosporine A-resistant CAR-T cells mediate antitumour immunity in the presence of allogeneic cells,"Yixi Zhang, Hongyu Fang, Guocan Wang, Guangxun Yuan, Ruoyu Dong, Jijun Luo, Yu Lyu, Yajie Wang, Peng Li, Chun Zhou, Weiwei Yin, Haowen Xiao, Jie Sun, Xun Zeng",2023-12-20,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy requires autologous T lymphocytes from cancer patients, a process that is both costly and complex. Universal CAR-T cell treatment from allogeneic sources can overcome this limitation but is impeded by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and host versus-graft rejection (HvGR). Here, we introduce a mutated calcineurin subunit A (CNA) and a CD19-specific CAR into the T cell receptor α constant (TRAC) locus to generate cells that are resistant to the widely used immunosuppressant, cyclosporine A (CsA). These immunosuppressant-resistant universal (IRU) CAR-T cells display improved effector function in vitro and anti-tumour efficacy in a leukemia xenograft mouse model in the presence of CsA, compared with CAR-T cells carrying wild-type CNA. Moreover, IRU CAR-T cells retain effector function in vitro and in vivo in the presence of both allogeneic T cells and CsA. Lastly, CsA withdrawal restores HvGR, acting as a safety switch that can eliminate IRU CAR-T cells. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of CsA-resistant CAR-T cells as a universal, ‘off-the-shelf’ treatment option.",

Here, we perform a comprehensive deep learning-based phenotyping of multiple cohorts of patients. We show that deep learning can reproduce the diagnosis of HCC vs. CCA with a high performance. We analyze a series of 405 cHCC-CCA patients and demonstrate that the model can reclassify the tumors as HCC or ICCA, and that the predictions are consistent with clinical outcomes, genetic alterations and in situ spatial gene expression profiling.

The approval was based on the NAVIGATOR trial, which revealed overall response rates of more than 90%. Despite this transformational activity, patients eventually progress, mostly due to acquired resistance mutations or following discontinuation due to neuro-cognitive side effects. These patients have no therapeutic alternative and face a dismal prognosis. Notable, little is known about this drug’s binding mode and its medicinal chemistry development, which is instrumental for the development of the next generation of drugs. Against this background, we solve the crystal structures of avapritinib in complex with wild-type and mutant PDGFRA and stem cell factor receptor (KIT), which provide evidence and understanding of inhibitor binding and lead to the identification of a sub-pocket (Gα-pocket). We utilize this information to design, synthesize and characterize avapritinib derivatives for the determination of key pharmacophoric features to overcome drug resistance and limit potential blood-brain barrier penetration.",

One of the main hurdles in solid tumors is the lack of sufficient T-cell infiltrate. Here, we show that pre-treatment vaccination, even when composed of tumor-unrelated antigens, induces CXCR3-mediated T-cell influx in immunologically ‘cold’ tumor models in male mice. In the absence of CD3 bsAb, the infiltrate is confined to the tumor invasive margin, whereas subsequent CD3 bsAb administration induces infiltration of activated effector CD8 T cells into the tumor cell nests. This combination therapy installs a broadly inflamed Th1-type tumor microenvironment, resulting in effective tumor eradication. Multiple vaccination formulations, including synthetic long peptides and viruses, empower CD3 bsAb therapy. Our results imply that eliciting tumor infiltration with vaccine-induced tumor-(un)related T cells can greatly improve the efficacy of CD3 bsAbs in solid tumors.",

Here we show that human NKTs expressing the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12) undergo extensive and sustained molecular and functional reprogramming. Specifically, IL-12 instructs and maintains a Th1-polarization program in NKTs in vivo without causing their functional exhaustion. Furthermore, using CD62L as a marker of memory cells in human NKTs, we observe that IL-12 maintains long-term CD62L-expressing memory NKTs in vivo. Notably, IL-12 initiates a de novo programming of memory NKTs in CD62L-negative NKTs indicating that human NKTs circulating in the peripheral blood possess an intrinsic differentiation hierarchy, and that IL-12 plays a role in promoting their differentiation to long-lived Th1-polarized memory cells. Human NKTs engineered to co-express a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) coupled with the expression of IL-12 show enhanced antitumor activity in leukemia and neuroblastoma tumor models, persist long-term in vivo and conserve the molecular signature driven by the IL-12 expression. Thus IL-12 reveals an intrinsic plasticity of peripheral human NKTs that may play a crucial role in the development of cell therapeutics.",
Stabilization of Pin1 by USP34 promotes Ubc9 isomerization and protein sumoylation in glioma stem cells,"Qiuhong Zhu, Panpan Liang, Hao Meng, Fangzhen Li, Wei Miao, Cuiying Chu, Wei Wang, Dongxue Li, Cong Chen, Yu Shi, Xingjiang Yu, Yifang Ping, Chaoshi Niu, Hai-bo Wu, Aili Zhang, Xiu-wu Bian, Wenchao Zhou",2024-01-02,"The peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Pin1 is a pivotal therapeutic target in cancers, but the regulation of Pin1 protein stability is largely unknown. High Pin1 expression is associated with SUMO1-modified protein hypersumoylation in glioma stem cells (GSCs), but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that Pin1 is deubiquitinated and stabilized by USP34, which promotes isomerization of the sole SUMO E2 enzyme Ubc9, leading to SUMO1-modified hypersumoylation to support GSC maintenance. Pin1 interacts with USP34, a deubiquitinase with preferential expression and oncogenic function in GSCs. Such interaction is facilitated by Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Pin1. Disruption of USP34 or inhibition of Plk1 promotes poly-ubiquitination and degradation of Pin1. Furthermore, Pin1 isomerizes Ubc9 to upregulate Ubc9 thioester formation with SUMO1, which requires CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ubc9. Combined inhibition of Pin1 and CDK1 with sulfopin and RO3306 most effectively suppresses orthotopic tumor growth. Our findings provide multiple molecular targets to induce Pin1 degradation and suppress hypersumoylation for cancer treatment.",
